First Citizen: <EOS>
Before we go any further, listen to me.  <EOS>
Everyone <EOS>
Speak, speak. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Would you rather die than starve to death?  <EOS>
Everyone: <EOS>
We would, we would. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
First of all, you know that Caius Marcius is the greatest enemy of the people.  <EOS>
Everyone: <EOS>
We know, we know. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Let’s kill him and set the grain prices as we wish. <EOS>
Is this a decision? <EOS>
Everyone: <EOS>
Let’s not talk anymore; let it be done: come on, come on! <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
One word, good citizens. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
We are seen as poor citizens, while the patricians are considered good. <EOS>
If they gave us everything they hoard with their authority, <EOS>
and if that would benefit us, we might think they were acting humanely; <EOS>
but they find us too expensive. <EOS>
The poverty that weakens us is like a list of their abundance. <EOS>
Our suffering becomes their profit. <EOS>
Let’s respond with our spears before we become mere rakes. <EOS>
The gods know that I say this out of hunger for bread, <EOS>
not thirst for revenge. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
Are you thinking of attacking Caius Marcius in particular? <EOS>
Everyon <EOS>
Him first: He is nothing but a dog, a man who despises the people.   <EOS>
Second Citizen <EOS>
Well, have you ever considered his services to his country?  <EOS>
First Citizen <EOS>
Yes, we know them very well; that’s why we are willing to grant him a fine reputation for his deeds, but he rewards himself with pride.  <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
No, but do not speak ill-intentionally. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
I tell you, everything he did so famously, he did with a purpose: <EOS>
Sensitive-minded men may say he did these things for his country; <EOS>
but he did them to please his mother and partly to take pride in himself. <EOS>
And this pride extends to the peak of his virtue. <EOS>
Second Citizen <EOS>
You see a flaw in him that he cannot correct by nature. <EOS>
You must not say he is greedy.  <EOS>
First Citizen <EOS>
If I must not say it, I still won’t hold back from making accusations. <EOS>
He has so many flaws that can be told over and over again. <EOS>
What are these shouts about? The other side of the city has revolted: <EOS>
Why are we idly talking here? Let’s go to the Senate!   <EOS>
Everyone: <EOS>
Let’s go, let’s go!   <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Wait! Who is coming here? <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
The honorable Menenius Agrippa; a man who has always loved the people. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
He is quite an honest man; if only the others were like him!  <EOS>
Menenius <EOS>
What is the matter, my fellow citizens? Where are you going with these sticks and clubs? <EOS>
What is the issue? Please tell me.  <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Our issue is not unknown to the Senate; <EOS>
we have hinted at what we intend to do for two weeks, <EOS>
and now we will show it with our actions. <EOS>
It is said that the strong breath of poor plaintiffs is powerful; <EOS>
now they will know that we have strong arms.  <EOS>
Menenius <EOS>
Ah, my friends, my honest neighbors, <EOS>
will you destroy yourselves? <EOS>
First Citizen <EOS>
We cannot, sir, for we are already destroyed. <EOS>
Menenius: <EOS>
I tell you, friends, the patricians have great affection for you. <EOS>
Your needs, the hardships you suffer in this famine, <EOS>
raising your sticks against the Roman state <EOS>
would be like raising them to the sky. <EOS>
The order of the state, stronger than you, <EOS>
will continue its course by untying ten thousand knots. <EOS>
The gods should be blamed for this famine, not the patricians. <EOS>
Kneel before them, not your weapons. Ah, alas, <EOS>
misfortune has carried you away to another place, <EOS>
where more trouble awaits you, and you, <EOS>
who are slandering the rulers of the state who look upon you as a father, <EOS>
curse them as if they were your enemies.  <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Do they care for us? Right, indeed! <EOS>
They have never cared for us: <EOS>
They leave us to starve to death, <EOS>
while their granaries overflow with grain; <EOS>
they make laws to support usury, <EOS>
constantly revoke beneficial laws passed against the rich, <EOS>
and every day enact harsher rules <EOS>
to chain and restrict the poor. <EOS>
If wars do not destroy us, they will; <EOS>
that is how much they love us.  <EOS>
Menenius <EOS>
Either you must accuse yourselves of extreme malice <EOS>
or be charged with foolishness. <EOS>
I will tell you a pleasant story: <EOS>
perhaps you have heard it before; <EOS>
but I will dare to tell it again to explain my point.  <EOS>
First Citizen <EOS>
Very well, I will listen, sir; <EOS>
but do not think you will distract us from our shame with a story: <EOS>
still, please go on.  <EOS>
Menenius <EOS>
Once upon a time, all the members of the body <EOS>
rebelled against the belly and accused it as follows: <EOS>
as if it were a hollow and idle pit in the middle of the body, <EOS>
storing food but not working like the other members; <EOS>
while the others saw, heard, thought, commanded, walked, felt, <EOS>
and labored for the common appetite and desire of the body. <EOS>
The belly then replied to them as follows—   <EOS>
**First Citizen:** <EOS>
Well, sir, what did the belly reply? <EOS>
Menenius: <EOS>
Sir, I will tell yo <EOS>
