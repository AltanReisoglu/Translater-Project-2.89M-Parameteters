# Translater-Project-2.89M-Parameteters
This is a translator project.In this project, I created a translation artificial intelligence using pytorch, tensorflow libraries in transformer architecture.Since a small part of the Shekaspeare dataset is used for training, it may contain small errors.Soon the huggingface space will be created for this project.You can use the model in ipynb file
