First Citizen: <EOS>
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak. <EOS>
All: <EOS>
Speak, speak. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish? <EOS>
All: <EOS>
Resolved. resolved. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people. <EOS>
All: <EOS>
We know't, we know't. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price. <EOS>
Is't a verdict? <EOS>
All: <EOS>
No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away! <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
One word, good citizens. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. <EOS>
What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they <EOS>
would yield us but the superfluity, while it were <EOS>
wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely; <EOS>
but they think we are too dear: the leanness that <EOS>
afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an <EOS>
inventory to particularise their abundance; our <EOS>
sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with <EOS>
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I <EOS>
speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius? <EOS>
All: <EOS>
Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
Consider you what services he has done for his country? <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Very well; and could be content to give him good <EOS>
report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
Nay, but speak not maliciously. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did <EOS>
it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be <EOS>
content to say it was for his country he did it to <EOS>
please his mother and to be partly proud; which he <EOS>
is, even till the altitude of his virtue. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
What he cannot help in his nature, you account a <EOS>
vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations; <EOS>
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition. <EOS>
What shouts are these? The other side o' the city <EOS>
is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol! <EOS>
All: <EOS>
Come, come. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Soft! who comes here? <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved <EOS>
the people. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you <EOS>
With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have <EOS>
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, <EOS>
which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor <EOS>
suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we <EOS>
have strong arms too. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours, <EOS>
Will you undo yourselves? <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
We cannot, sir, we are undone already. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I tell you, friends, most charitable care <EOS>
Have the patricians of you. For your wants, <EOS>
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well <EOS>
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them <EOS>
Against the Roman state, whose course will on <EOS>
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs <EOS>
Of more strong link asunder than can ever <EOS>
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth, <EOS>
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and <EOS>
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack, <EOS>
You are transported by calamity <EOS>
Thither where more attends you, and you slander <EOS>
The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers, <EOS>
When you curse them as enemies. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us <EOS>
yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses <EOS>
crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to <EOS>
support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act <EOS>
established against the rich, and provide more <EOS>
piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain <EOS>
the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and <EOS>
there's all the love they bear us. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Either you must <EOS>
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious, <EOS>
Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you <EOS>
A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it; <EOS>
But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture <EOS>
To stale 't a little more. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to <EOS>
fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please <EOS>
you, deliver. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
There was a time when all the body's members <EOS>
Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it: <EOS>
That only like a gulf it did remain <EOS>
I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive, <EOS>
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing <EOS>
Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments <EOS>
Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel, <EOS>
And, mutually participate, did minister <EOS>
Unto the appetite and affection common <EOS>
Of the whole body. The belly answer'd-- <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Well, sir, what answer made the belly? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile, <EOS>
Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus-- <EOS>
For, look you, I may make the belly smile <EOS>
As well as speak--it tauntingly replied <EOS>
To the discontented members, the mutinous parts <EOS>
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly <EOS>
As you malign our senators for that <EOS>
They are not such as you. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Your belly's answer? What! <EOS>
The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye, <EOS>
The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier, <EOS>
Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter. <EOS>
With other muniments and petty helps <EOS>
In this our fabric, if that they-- <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
What then? <EOS>
'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then? <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd, <EOS>
Who is the sink o' the body,-- <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Well, what then? <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
The former agents, if they did complain, <EOS>
What could the belly answer? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I will tell you <EOS>
If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little-- <EOS>
Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Ye're long about it. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Note me this, good friend; <EOS>
Your most grave belly was deliberate, <EOS>
Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd: <EOS>
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he, <EOS>
'That I receive the general food at first, <EOS>
Which you do live upon; and fit it is, <EOS>
Because I am the store-house and the shop <EOS>
Of the whole body: but, if you do remember, <EOS>
I send it through the rivers of your blood, <EOS>
Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain; <EOS>
And, through the cranks and offices of man, <EOS>
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins <EOS>
From me receive that natural competency <EOS>
Whereby they live: and though that all at once, <EOS>
You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,-- <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Ay, sir; well, well. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
'Though all at once cannot <EOS>
See what I do deliver out to each, <EOS>
Yet I can make my audit up, that all <EOS>
From me do back receive the flour of all, <EOS>
And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't? <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
It was an answer: how apply you this? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
The senators of Rome are this good belly, <EOS>
And you the mutinous members; for examine <EOS>
Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly <EOS>
Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find <EOS>
No public benefit which you receive <EOS>
But it proceeds or comes from them to you <EOS>
And no way from yourselves. What do you think, <EOS>
You, the great toe of this assembly? <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
I the great toe! why the great toe? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest, <EOS>
Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost: <EOS>
Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run, <EOS>
Lead'st first to win some vantage. <EOS>
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs: <EOS>
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle; <EOS>
The one side must have bale. <EOS>
Hail, noble Marcius! <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, <EOS>
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, <EOS>
Make yourselves scabs? <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
We have ever your good word. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
He that will give good words to thee will flatter <EOS>
Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs, <EOS>
That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you, <EOS>
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you, <EOS>
Where he should find you lions, finds you hares; <EOS>
Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no, <EOS>
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice, <EOS>
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is <EOS>
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him <EOS>
And curse that justice did it. <EOS>
Who deserves greatness <EOS>
Deserves your hate; and your affections are <EOS>
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that <EOS>
Which would increase his evil. He that depends <EOS>
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead <EOS>
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye? <EOS>
With every minute you do change a mind, <EOS>
And call him noble that was now your hate, <EOS>
Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter, <EOS>
That in these several places of the city <EOS>
You cry against the noble senate, who, <EOS>
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else <EOS>
Would feed on one another? What's their seeking? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say, <EOS>
The city is well stored. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Hang 'em! They say! <EOS>
They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know <EOS>
What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise, <EOS>
Who thrives and who declines; side factions <EOS>
and give out <EOS>
Conjectural marriages; making parties strong <EOS>
And feebling such as stand not in their liking <EOS>
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's <EOS>
grain enough! <EOS>
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth, <EOS>
And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry <EOS>
With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high <EOS>
As I could pick my lance. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded; <EOS>
For though abundantly they lack discretion, <EOS>
Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you, <EOS>
What says the other troop? <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
They are dissolved: hang 'em! <EOS>
They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs, <EOS>
That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat, <EOS>
That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not <EOS>
Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds <EOS>
They vented their complainings; which being answer'd, <EOS>
And a petition granted them, a strange one-- <EOS>
To break the heart of generosity, <EOS>
And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps <EOS>
As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon, <EOS>
Shouting their emulation. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
What is granted them? <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms, <EOS>
Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus, <EOS>
Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath! <EOS>
The rabble should have first unroof'd the city, <EOS>
Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time <EOS>
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes <EOS>
For insurrection's arguing. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
This is strange. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Go, get you home, you fragments! <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Where's Caius Marcius? <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Here: what's the matter? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent <EOS>
Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us; <EOS>
The Volsces are in arms. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
They have a leader, <EOS>
Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't. <EOS>
I sin in envying his nobility, <EOS>
And were I any thing but what I am, <EOS>
I would wish me only he. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
You have fought together. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Were half to half the world by the ears and he. <EOS>
Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make <EOS>
Only my wars with him: he is a lion <EOS>
That I am proud to hunt. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Then, worthy Marcius, <EOS>
Attend upon Cominius to these wars. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
It is your former promise. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Sir, it is; <EOS>
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou <EOS>
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face. <EOS>
What, art thou stiff? stand'st out? <EOS>
TITUS: <EOS>
No, Caius Marcius; <EOS>
I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other, <EOS>
Ere stay behind this business. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
O, true-bred! <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Your company to the Capitol; where, I know, <EOS>
Our greatest friends attend us. <EOS>
TITUS: <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Noble Marcius! <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Nay, let them follow: <EOS>
The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither <EOS>
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners, <EOS>
Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius? <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
He has no equal. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
When we were chosen tribunes for the people,-- <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Mark'd you his lip and eyes? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Nay. but his taunts. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Be-mock the modest moon. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
The present wars devour him: he is grown <EOS>
Too proud to be so valiant. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Such a nature, <EOS>
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow <EOS>
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder <EOS>
His insolence can brook to be commanded <EOS>
Under Cominius. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Fame, at the which he aims, <EOS>
In whom already he's well graced, can not <EOS>
Better be held nor more attain'd than by <EOS>
A place below the first: for what miscarries <EOS>
Shall be the general's fault, though he perform <EOS>
To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure <EOS>
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he <EOS>
Had borne the business!' <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Besides, if things go well, <EOS>
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall <EOS>
Of his demerits rob Cominius. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Come: <EOS>
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius. <EOS>
Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults <EOS>
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed <EOS>
In aught he merit not. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Let's hence, and hear <EOS>
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion, <EOS>
More than his singularity, he goes <EOS>
Upon this present action. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Lets along. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
So, your opinion is, Aufidius, <EOS>
That they of Rome are entered in our counsels <EOS>
And know how we proceed. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Is it not yours? <EOS>
What ever have been thought on in this state, <EOS>
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome <EOS>
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone <EOS>
Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think <EOS>
I have the letter here; yes, here it is. <EOS>
'They have press'd a power, but it is not known <EOS>
Whether for east or west: the dearth is great; <EOS>
The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd, <EOS>
Cominius, Marcius your old enemy, <EOS>
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you, <EOS>
And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman, <EOS>
These three lead on this preparation <EOS>
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you: <EOS>
Consider of it.' <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Our army's in the field <EOS>
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready <EOS>
To answer us. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Nor did you think it folly <EOS>
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when <EOS>
They needs must show themselves; which <EOS>
in the hatching, <EOS>
It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery. <EOS>
We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was <EOS>
To take in many towns ere almost Rome <EOS>
Should know we were afoot. <EOS>
Second Senator: <EOS>
Noble Aufidius, <EOS>
Take your commission; hie you to your bands: <EOS>
Let us alone to guard Corioli: <EOS>
If they set down before 's, for the remove <EOS>
Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find <EOS>
They've not prepared for us. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
O, doubt not that; <EOS>
I speak from certainties. Nay, more, <EOS>
Some parcels of their power are forth already, <EOS>
And only hitherward. I leave your honours. <EOS>
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet, <EOS>
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike <EOS>
Till one can do no more. <EOS>
All: <EOS>
The gods assist you! <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
And keep your honours safe! <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Farewell. <EOS>
Second Senator: <EOS>
Farewell. <EOS>
All: <EOS>
Farewell. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a <EOS>
more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I <EOS>
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he <EOS>
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where <EOS>
he would show most love. When yet he was but <EOS>
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when <EOS>
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when <EOS>
for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not <EOS>
sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering <EOS>
how honour would become such a person. that it was <EOS>
no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if <EOS>
renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek <EOS>
danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel <EOS>
war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows <EOS>
bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not <EOS>
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child <EOS>
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a <EOS>
man. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
But had he died in the business, madam; how then? <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Then his good report should have been my son; I <EOS>
therein would have found issue. Hear me profess <EOS>
sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love <EOS>
alike and none less dear than thine and my good <EOS>
Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their <EOS>
country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action. <EOS>
Gentlewoman: <EOS>
Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Indeed, you shall not. <EOS>
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum, <EOS>
See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair, <EOS>
As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him: <EOS>
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus: <EOS>
'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear, <EOS>
Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow <EOS>
With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes, <EOS>
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow <EOS>
Or all or lose his hire. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood! <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Away, you fool! it more becomes a man <EOS>
Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba, <EOS>
When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier <EOS>
Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood <EOS>
At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria, <EOS>
We are fit to bid her welcome. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius! <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee <EOS>
And tread upon his neck. <EOS>
VALERIA: <EOS>
My ladies both, good day to you. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Sweet madam. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
I am glad to see your ladyship. <EOS>
VALERIA: <EOS>
How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers. <EOS>
What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good <EOS>
faith. How does your little son? <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
I thank your ladyship; well, good madam. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than <EOS>
look upon his school-master. <EOS>
VALERIA: <EOS>
O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a <EOS>
very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o' <EOS>
Wednesday half an hour together: has such a <EOS>
confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded <EOS>
butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go <EOS>
again; and after it again; and over and over he <EOS>
comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his <EOS>
fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his <EOS>
teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked <EOS>
it! <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
One on 's father's moods. <EOS>
VALERIA: <EOS>
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
A crack, madam. <EOS>
VALERIA: <EOS>
Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play <EOS>
the idle husewife with me this afternoon. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
No, good madam; I will not out of doors. <EOS>
VALERIA: <EOS>
Not out of doors! <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
She shall, she shall. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the <EOS>
threshold till my lord return from the wars. <EOS>
VALERIA: <EOS>
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come, <EOS>
you must go visit the good lady that lies in. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with <EOS>
my prayers; but I cannot go thither. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Why, I pray you? <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love. <EOS>
VALERIA: <EOS>
You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all <EOS>
the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill <EOS>
Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric <EOS>
were sensible as your finger, that you might leave <EOS>
pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth. <EOS>
VALERIA: <EOS>
In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you <EOS>
excellent news of your husband. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
O, good madam, there can be none yet. <EOS>
VALERIA: <EOS>
Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from <EOS>
him last night. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
Indeed, madam? <EOS>
VALERIA: <EOS>
In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it. <EOS>
Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against <EOS>
whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of <EOS>
our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set <EOS>
down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt <EOS>
prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true, <EOS>
on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every <EOS>
thing hereafter. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but <EOS>
disease our better mirth. <EOS>
VALERIA: <EOS>
In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then. <EOS>
Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy <EOS>
solemness out o' door. and go along with us. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish <EOS>
you much mirth. <EOS>
VALERIA: <EOS>
Well, then, farewell. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Yonder comes news. A wager they have met. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
My horse to yours, no. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
'Tis done. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
Agreed. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Say, has our general met the enemy? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
So, the good horse is mine. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
I'll buy him of you. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will <EOS>
For half a hundred years. Summon the town. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
How far off lie these armies? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Within this mile and half. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours. <EOS>
Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work, <EOS>
That we with smoking swords may march from hence, <EOS>
To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast. <EOS>
Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls? <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
No, nor a man that fears you less than he, <EOS>
That's lesser than a little. <EOS>
Hark! our drums <EOS>
Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls, <EOS>
Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates, <EOS>
Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes; <EOS>
They'll open of themselves. <EOS>
Hark you. far off! <EOS>
There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes <EOS>
Amongst your cloven army. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
O, they are at it! <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho! <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
They fear us not, but issue forth their city. <EOS>
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight <EOS>
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance, <EOS>
brave Titus: <EOS>
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts, <EOS>
Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows: <EOS>
He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce, <EOS>
And he shall feel mine edge. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
All the contagion of the south light on you, <EOS>
You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues <EOS>
Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd <EOS>
Further than seen and one infect another <EOS>
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese, <EOS>
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run <EOS>
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell! <EOS>
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale <EOS>
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home, <EOS>
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe <EOS>
And make my wars on you: look to't: come on; <EOS>
If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives, <EOS>
As they us to our trenches followed. <EOS>
So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds: <EOS>
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them, <EOS>
Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like. <EOS>
First Soldier: <EOS>
Fool-hardiness; not I. <EOS>
Second Soldier: <EOS>
Nor I. <EOS>
First Soldier: <EOS>
See, they have shut him in. <EOS>
All: <EOS>
To the pot, I warrant him. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
What is become of Marcius? <EOS>
All: <EOS>
Slain, sir, doubtless. <EOS>
First Soldier: <EOS>
Following the fliers at the very heels, <EOS>
With them he enters; who, upon the sudden, <EOS>
Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone, <EOS>
To answer all the city. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
O noble fellow! <EOS>
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword, <EOS>
And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius: <EOS>
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art, <EOS>
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier <EOS>
Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible <EOS>
Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and <EOS>
The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds, <EOS>
Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world <EOS>
Were feverous and did tremble. <EOS>
First Soldier: <EOS>
Look, sir. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
O,'tis Marcius! <EOS>
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike. <EOS>
First Roman: <EOS>
This will I carry to Rome. <EOS>
Second Roman: <EOS>
And I this. <EOS>
Third Roman: <EOS>
A murrain on't! I took this for silver. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
See here these movers that do prize their hours <EOS>
At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons, <EOS>
Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would <EOS>
Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves, <EOS>
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them! <EOS>
And hark, what noise the general makes! To him! <EOS>
There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius, <EOS>
Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take <EOS>
Convenient numbers to make good the city; <EOS>
Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste <EOS>
To help Cominius. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
Worthy sir, thou bleed'st; <EOS>
Thy exercise hath been too violent for <EOS>
A second course of fight. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Sir, praise me not; <EOS>
My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well: <EOS>
The blood I drop is rather physical <EOS>
Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus <EOS>
I will appear, and fight. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
Now the fair goddess, Fortune, <EOS>
Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms <EOS>
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman, <EOS>
Prosperity be thy page! <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Thy friend no less <EOS>
Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
Thou worthiest Marcius! <EOS>
Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place; <EOS>
Call thither all the officers o' the town, <EOS>
Where they shall know our mind: away! <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Breathe you, my friends: well fought; <EOS>
we are come off <EOS>
Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands, <EOS>
Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs, <EOS>
We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck, <EOS>
By interims and conveying gusts we have heard <EOS>
The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods! <EOS>
Lead their successes as we wish our own, <EOS>
That both our powers, with smiling <EOS>
fronts encountering, <EOS>
May give you thankful sacrifice. <EOS>
Thy news? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
The citizens of Corioli have issued, <EOS>
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle: <EOS>
I saw our party to their trenches driven, <EOS>
And then I came away. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Though thou speak'st truth, <EOS>
Methinks thou speak'st not well. <EOS>
How long is't since? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Above an hour, my lord. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums: <EOS>
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour, <EOS>
And bring thy news so late? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Spies of the Volsces <EOS>
Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel <EOS>
Three or four miles about, else had I, sir, <EOS>
Half an hour since brought my report. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Who's yonder, <EOS>
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods <EOS>
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have <EOS>
Before-time seen him thus. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour <EOS>
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue <EOS>
From every meaner man. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Come I too late? <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Ay, if you come not in the blood of others, <EOS>
But mantled in your own. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
O, let me clip ye <EOS>
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart <EOS>
As merry as when our nuptial day was done, <EOS>
And tapers burn'd to bedward! <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Flower of warriors, <EOS>
How is it with Titus Lartius? <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
As with a man busied about decrees: <EOS>
Condemning some to death, and some to exile; <EOS>
Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other; <EOS>
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome, <EOS>
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash, <EOS>
To let him slip at will. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Where is that slave <EOS>
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches? <EOS>
Where is he? call him hither. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Let him alone; <EOS>
He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen, <EOS>
The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!-- <EOS>
The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge <EOS>
From rascals worse than they. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
But how prevail'd you? <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Will the time serve to tell? I do not think. <EOS>
Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field? <EOS>
If not, why cease you till you are so? <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Marcius, <EOS>
We have at disadvantage fought and did <EOS>
Retire to win our purpose. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
How lies their battle? know you on which side <EOS>
They have placed their men of trust? <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
As I guess, Marcius, <EOS>
Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates, <EOS>
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius, <EOS>
Their very heart of hope. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
I do beseech you, <EOS>
By all the battles wherein we have fought, <EOS>
By the blood we have shed together, by the vows <EOS>
We have made to endure friends, that you directly <EOS>
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates; <EOS>
And that you not delay the present, but, <EOS>
Filling the air with swords advanced and darts, <EOS>
We prove this very hour. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Though I could wish <EOS>
You were conducted to a gentle bath <EOS>
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never <EOS>
Deny your asking: take your choice of those <EOS>
That best can aid your action. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Those are they <EOS>
That most are willing. If any such be here-- <EOS>
As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting <EOS>
Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear <EOS>
Lesser his person than an ill report; <EOS>
If any think brave death outweighs bad life <EOS>
And that his country's dearer than himself; <EOS>
Let him alone, or so many so minded, <EOS>
Wave thus, to express his disposition, <EOS>
And follow Marcius. <EOS>
O, me alone! make you a sword of me? <EOS>
If these shows be not outward, which of you <EOS>
But is four Volsces? none of you but is <EOS>
Able to bear against the great Aufidius <EOS>
A shield as hard as his. A certain number, <EOS>
Though thanks to all, must I select <EOS>
from all: the rest <EOS>
Shall bear the business in some other fight, <EOS>
As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march; <EOS>
And four shall quickly draw out my command, <EOS>
Which men are best inclined. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
March on, my fellows: <EOS>
Make good this ostentation, and you shall <EOS>
Divide in all with us. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties, <EOS>
As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch <EOS>
Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve <EOS>
For a short holding: if we lose the field, <EOS>
We cannot keep the town. <EOS>
Lieutenant: <EOS>
Fear not our care, sir. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
Hence, and shut your gates upon's. <EOS>
Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee <EOS>
Worse than a promise-breaker. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
We hate alike: <EOS>
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor <EOS>
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Let the first budger die the other's slave, <EOS>
And the gods doom him after! <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
If I fly, Marcius, <EOS>
Holloa me like a hare. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Within these three hours, Tullus, <EOS>
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls, <EOS>
And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood <EOS>
Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge <EOS>
Wrench up thy power to the highest. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Wert thou the Hector <EOS>
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny, <EOS>
Thou shouldst not scape me here. <EOS>
Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me <EOS>
In your condemned seconds. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work, <EOS>
Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it <EOS>
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles, <EOS>
Where great patricians shall attend and shrug, <EOS>
I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted, <EOS>
And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the <EOS>
dull tribunes, <EOS>
That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours, <EOS>
Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods <EOS>
Our Rome hath such a soldier.' <EOS>
Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast, <EOS>
Having fully dined before. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
O general, <EOS>
Here is the steed, we the caparison: <EOS>
Hadst thou beheld-- <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
Pray now, no more: my mother, <EOS>
Who has a charter to extol her blood, <EOS>
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done <EOS>
As you have done; that's what I can; induced <EOS>
As you have been; that's for my country: <EOS>
He that has but effected his good will <EOS>
Hath overta'en mine act. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
You shall not be <EOS>
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know <EOS>
The value of her own: 'twere a concealment <EOS>
Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement, <EOS>
To hide your doings; and to silence that, <EOS>
Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd, <EOS>
Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you <EOS>
In sign of what you are, not to reward <EOS>
What you have done--before our army hear me. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
I have some wounds upon me, and they smart <EOS>
To hear themselves remember'd. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Should they not, <EOS>
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude, <EOS>
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses, <EOS>
Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all <EOS>
The treasure in this field achieved and city, <EOS>
We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth, <EOS>
Before the common distribution, at <EOS>
Your only choice. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
I thank you, general; <EOS>
But cannot make my heart consent to take <EOS>
A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it; <EOS>
And stand upon my common part with those <EOS>
That have beheld the doing. <EOS>
MARCIUS: <EOS>
May these same instruments, which you profane, <EOS>
Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall <EOS>
I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be <EOS>
Made all of false-faced soothing! <EOS>
When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk, <EOS>
Let him be made a coverture for the wars! <EOS>
No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd <EOS>
My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.-- <EOS>
Which, without note, here's many else have done,-- <EOS>
You shout me forth <EOS>
In acclamations hyperbolical; <EOS>
As if I loved my little should be dieted <EOS>
In praises sauced with lies. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Too modest are you; <EOS>
More cruel to your good report than grateful <EOS>
To us that give you truly: by your patience, <EOS>
If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you, <EOS>
Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles, <EOS>
Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known, <EOS>
As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius <EOS>
Wears this war's garland: in token of the which, <EOS>
My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him, <EOS>
With all his trim belonging; and from this time, <EOS>
For what he did before Corioli, call him, <EOS>
With all the applause and clamour of the host, <EOS>
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear <EOS>
The addition nobly ever! <EOS>
All: <EOS>
Caius Marcius Coriolanus! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I will go wash; <EOS>
And when my face is fair, you shall perceive <EOS>
Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you. <EOS>
I mean to stride your steed, and at all times <EOS>
To undercrest your good addition <EOS>
To the fairness of my power. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
So, to our tent; <EOS>
Where, ere we do repose us, we will write <EOS>
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius, <EOS>
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome <EOS>
The best, with whom we may articulate, <EOS>
For their own good and ours. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
I shall, my lord. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
The gods begin to mock me. I, that now <EOS>
Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg <EOS>
Of my lord general. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Take't; 'tis yours. What is't? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I sometime lay here in Corioli <EOS>
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly: <EOS>
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner; <EOS>
But then Aufidius was within my view, <EOS>
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you <EOS>
To give my poor host freedom. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
O, well begg'd! <EOS>
Were he the butcher of my son, he should <EOS>
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus. <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
Marcius, his name? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
By Jupiter! forgot. <EOS>
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired. <EOS>
Have we no wine here? <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Go we to our tent: <EOS>
The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time <EOS>
It should be look'd to: come. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
The town is ta'en! <EOS>
First Soldier: <EOS>
'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Condition! <EOS>
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot, <EOS>
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition! <EOS>
What good condition can a treaty find <EOS>
I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius, <EOS>
I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me, <EOS>
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter <EOS>
As often as we eat. By the elements, <EOS>
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard, <EOS>
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation <EOS>
Hath not that honour in't it had; for where <EOS>
I thought to crush him in an equal force, <EOS>
True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way <EOS>
Or wrath or craft may get him. <EOS>
First Soldier: <EOS>
He's the devil. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd <EOS>
With only suffering stain by him; for him <EOS>
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary, <EOS>
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol, <EOS>
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice, <EOS>
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up <EOS>
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst <EOS>
My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it <EOS>
At home, upon my brother's guard, even there, <EOS>
Against the hospitable canon, would I <EOS>
Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city; <EOS>
Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must <EOS>
Be hostages for Rome. <EOS>
First Soldier: <EOS>
Will not you go? <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you-- <EOS>
'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither <EOS>
How the world goes, that to the pace of it <EOS>
I may spur on my journey. <EOS>
First Soldier: <EOS>
I shall, sir. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Good or bad? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they <EOS>
love not Marcius. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Pray you, who does the wolf love? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
The lamb. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the <EOS>
noble Marcius. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two <EOS>
are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you. <EOS>
Both: <EOS>
Well, sir. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two <EOS>
have not in abundance? <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Especially in pride. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
And topping all others in boasting. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
This is strange now: do you two know how you are <EOS>
censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the <EOS>
right-hand file? do you? <EOS>
Both: <EOS>
Why, how are we censured? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry? <EOS>
Both: <EOS>
Well, well, sir, well. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of <EOS>
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience: <EOS>
give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at <EOS>
your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a <EOS>
pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for <EOS>
being proud? <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
We do it not alone, sir. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I know you can do very little alone; for your helps <EOS>
are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous <EOS>
single: your abilities are too infant-like for <EOS>
doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you <EOS>
could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks, <EOS>
and make but an interior survey of your good selves! <EOS>
O that you could! <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
What then, sir? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, <EOS>
proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as <EOS>
any in Rome. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Menenius, you are known well enough too. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that <EOS>
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying <EOS>
Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in <EOS>
favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like <EOS>
upon too trivial motion; one that converses more <EOS>
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead <EOS>
of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my <EOS>
malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as <EOS>
you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink <EOS>
you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a <EOS>
crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have <EOS>
delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in <EOS>
compound with the major part of your syllables: and <EOS>
though I must be content to bear with those that say <EOS>
you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that <EOS>
tell you you have good faces. If you see this in <EOS>
the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known <EOS>
well enough too? what barm can your bisson <EOS>
conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be <EOS>
known well enough too? <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You <EOS>
are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you <EOS>
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a <EOS>
cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller; <EOS>
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a <EOS>
second day of audience. When you are hearing a <EOS>
matter between party and party, if you chance to be <EOS>
pinched with the colic, you make faces like <EOS>
mummers; set up the bloody flag against all <EOS>
patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, <EOS>
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled <EOS>
by your hearing: all the peace you make in their <EOS>
cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are <EOS>
a pair of strange ones. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Come, come, you are well understood to be a <EOS>
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary <EOS>
bencher in the Capitol. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall <EOS>
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When <EOS>
you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the <EOS>
wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not <EOS>
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's <EOS>
cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack- <EOS>
saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud; <EOS>
who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors <EOS>
since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the <EOS>
best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to <EOS>
your worships: more of your conversation would <EOS>
infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly <EOS>
plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you. <EOS>
How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon, <EOS>
were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow <EOS>
your eyes so fast? <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for <EOS>
the love of Juno, let's go. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Ha! Marcius coming home! <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous <EOS>
approbation. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo! <EOS>
Marcius coming home! <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Nay,'tis true. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath <EOS>
another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one <EOS>
at home for you. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for <EOS>
me! <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven <EOS>
years' health; in which time I will make a lip at <EOS>
the physician: the most sovereign prescription in <EOS>
Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative, <EOS>
of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he <EOS>
not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
O, no, no, no. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a' <EOS>
victory in his pocket? the wounds become him. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home <EOS>
with the oaken garland. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly? <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but <EOS>
Aufidius got off. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that: <EOS>
an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so <EOS>
fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold <EOS>
that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this? <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate <EOS>
has letters from the general, wherein he gives my <EOS>
son the whole name of the war: he hath in this <EOS>
action outdone his former deeds doubly <EOS>
VALERIA: <EOS>
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his <EOS>
true purchasing. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
The gods grant them true! <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
True! pow, wow. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
True! I'll be sworn they are true. <EOS>
Where is he wounded? <EOS>
God save your good worships! Marcius is coming <EOS>
home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded? <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be <EOS>
large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall <EOS>
stand for his place. He received in the repulse of <EOS>
Tarquin seven hurts i' the body. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's <EOS>
nine that I know. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five <EOS>
wounds upon him. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave. <EOS>
Hark! the trumpets. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he <EOS>
carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears: <EOS>
Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie; <EOS>
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die. <EOS>
Herald: <EOS>
Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight <EOS>
Within Corioli gates: where he hath won, <EOS>
With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these <EOS>
In honour follows Coriolanus. <EOS>
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus! <EOS>
All: <EOS>
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
No more of this; it does offend my heart: <EOS>
Pray now, no more. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Look, sir, your mother! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
O, <EOS>
You have, I know, petition'd all the gods <EOS>
For my prosperity! <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Nay, my good soldier, up; <EOS>
My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and <EOS>
By deed-achieving honour newly named,-- <EOS>
What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?-- <EOS>
But O, thy wife! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
My gracious silence, hail! <EOS>
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home, <EOS>
That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear, <EOS>
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear, <EOS>
And mothers that lack sons. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Now, the gods crown thee! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
And live you yet? <EOS>
O my sweet lady, pardon. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
I know not where to turn: O, welcome home: <EOS>
And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep <EOS>
And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome. <EOS>
A curse begin at very root on's heart, <EOS>
That is not glad to see thee! You are three <EOS>
That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men, <EOS>
We have some old crab-trees here <EOS>
at home that will not <EOS>
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors: <EOS>
We call a nettle but a nettle and <EOS>
The faults of fools but folly. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Ever right. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Menenius ever, ever. <EOS>
Herald: <EOS>
Give way there, and go on! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
I have lived <EOS>
To see inherited my very wishes <EOS>
And the buildings of my fancy: only <EOS>
There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but <EOS>
Our Rome will cast upon thee. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Know, good mother, <EOS>
I had rather be their servant in my way, <EOS>
Than sway with them in theirs. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
On, to the Capitol! <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights <EOS>
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse <EOS>
Into a rapture lets her baby cry <EOS>
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins <EOS>
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck, <EOS>
Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows, <EOS>
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed <EOS>
With variable complexions, all agreeing <EOS>
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens <EOS>
Do press among the popular throngs and puff <EOS>
To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames <EOS>
Commit the war of white and damask in <EOS>
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil <EOS>
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother <EOS>
As if that whatsoever god who leads him <EOS>
Were slily crept into his human powers <EOS>
And gave him graceful posture. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
On the sudden, <EOS>
I warrant him consul. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Then our office may, <EOS>
During his power, go sleep. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
He cannot temperately transport his honours <EOS>
From where he should begin and end, but will <EOS>
Lose those he hath won. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
In that there's comfort. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Doubt not <EOS>
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they <EOS>
Upon their ancient malice will forget <EOS>
With the least cause these his new honours, which <EOS>
That he will give them make I as little question <EOS>
As he is proud to do't. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
I heard him swear, <EOS>
Were he to stand for consul, never would he <EOS>
Appear i' the market-place nor on him put <EOS>
The napless vesture of humility; <EOS>
Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds <EOS>
To the people, beg their stinking breaths. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
'Tis right. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
It was his word: O, he would miss it rather <EOS>
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him, <EOS>
And the desire of the nobles. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
I wish no better <EOS>
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it <EOS>
In execution. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
'Tis most like he will. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
It shall be to him then as our good wills, <EOS>
A sure destruction. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
So it must fall out <EOS>
To him or our authorities. For an end, <EOS>
We must suggest the people in what hatred <EOS>
He still hath held them; that to's power he would <EOS>
Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and <EOS>
Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them, <EOS>
In human action and capacity, <EOS>
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world <EOS>
Than camels in the war, who have their provand <EOS>
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows <EOS>
For sinking under them. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
This, as you say, suggested <EOS>
At some time when his soaring insolence <EOS>
Shall touch the people--which time shall not want, <EOS>
If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy <EOS>
As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire <EOS>
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze <EOS>
Shall darken him for ever. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
What's the matter? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought <EOS>
That Marcius shall be consul: <EOS>
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and <EOS>
The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves, <EOS>
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers, <EOS>
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended, <EOS>
As to Jove's statue, and the commons made <EOS>
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts: <EOS>
I never saw the like. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Let's to the Capitol; <EOS>
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time, <EOS>
But hearts for the event. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Have with you. <EOS>
First Officer: <EOS>
Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand <EOS>
for consulships? <EOS>
Second Officer: <EOS>
Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one <EOS>
Coriolanus will carry it. <EOS>
First Officer: <EOS>
That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and <EOS>
loves not the common people. <EOS>
Second Officer: <EOS>
Faith, there had been many great men that have <EOS>
flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there <EOS>
be many that they have loved, they know not <EOS>
wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why, <EOS>
they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for <EOS>
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate <EOS>
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their <EOS>
disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets <EOS>
them plainly see't. <EOS>
First Officer: <EOS>
If he did not care whether he had their love or no, <EOS>
he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither <EOS>
good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater <EOS>
devotion than can render it him; and leaves <EOS>
nothing undone that may fully discover him their <EOS>
opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and <EOS>
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he <EOS>
dislikes, to flatter them for their love. <EOS>
Second Officer: <EOS>
He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his <EOS>
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, <EOS>
having been supple and courteous to the people, <EOS>
bonneted, without any further deed to have them at <EOS>
an into their estimation and report: but he hath so <EOS>
planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions <EOS>
in their hearts, that for their tongues to be <EOS>
silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of <EOS>
ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a <EOS>
malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck <EOS>
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it. <EOS>
First Officer: <EOS>
No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they <EOS>
are coming. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Having determined of the Volsces and <EOS>
To send for Titus Lartius, it remains, <EOS>
As the main point of this our after-meeting, <EOS>
To gratify his noble service that <EOS>
Hath thus stood for his country: therefore, <EOS>
please you, <EOS>
Most reverend and grave elders, to desire <EOS>
The present consul, and last general <EOS>
In our well-found successes, to report <EOS>
A little of that worthy work perform'd <EOS>
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom <EOS>
We met here both to thank and to remember <EOS>
With honours like himself. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Speak, good Cominius: <EOS>
Leave nothing out for length, and make us think <EOS>
Rather our state's defective for requital <EOS>
Than we to stretch it out. <EOS>
Masters o' the people, <EOS>
We do request your kindest ears, and after, <EOS>
Your loving motion toward the common body, <EOS>
To yield what passes here. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
We are convented <EOS>
Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts <EOS>
Inclinable to honour and advance <EOS>
The theme of our assembly. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Which the rather <EOS>
We shall be blest to do, if he remember <EOS>
A kinder value of the people than <EOS>
He hath hereto prized them at. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
That's off, that's off; <EOS>
I would you rather had been silent. Please you <EOS>
To hear Cominius speak? <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Most willingly; <EOS>
But yet my caution was more pertinent <EOS>
Than the rebuke you give it. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
He loves your people <EOS>
But tie him not to be their bedfellow. <EOS>
Worthy Cominius, speak. <EOS>
Nay, keep your place. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear <EOS>
What you have nobly done. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Your horror's pardon: <EOS>
I had rather have my wounds to heal again <EOS>
Than hear say how I got them. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Sir, I hope <EOS>
My words disbench'd you not. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
No, sir: yet oft, <EOS>
When blows have made me stay, I fled from words. <EOS>
You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but <EOS>
your people, <EOS>
I love them as they weigh. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Pray now, sit down. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun <EOS>
When the alarum were struck than idly sit <EOS>
To hear my nothings monster'd. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Masters of the people, <EOS>
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-- <EOS>
That's thousand to one good one--when you now see <EOS>
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour <EOS>
Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus <EOS>
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held <EOS>
That valour is the chiefest virtue, and <EOS>
Most dignifies the haver: if it be, <EOS>
The man I speak of cannot in the world <EOS>
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years, <EOS>
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought <EOS>
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator, <EOS>
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight, <EOS>
When with his Amazonian chin he drove <EOS>
The bristled lips before him: be bestrid <EOS>
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view <EOS>
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met, <EOS>
And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats, <EOS>
When he might act the woman in the scene, <EOS>
He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed <EOS>
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age <EOS>
Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea, <EOS>
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since <EOS>
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last, <EOS>
Before and in Corioli, let me say, <EOS>
I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers; <EOS>
And by his rare example made the coward <EOS>
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before <EOS>
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd <EOS>
And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp, <EOS>
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot <EOS>
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion <EOS>
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd <EOS>
The mortal gate of the city, which he painted <EOS>
With shunless destiny; aidless came off, <EOS>
And with a sudden reinforcement struck <EOS>
Corioli like a planet: now all's his: <EOS>
When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce <EOS>
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit <EOS>
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate, <EOS>
And to the battle came he; where he did <EOS>
Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if <EOS>
'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd <EOS>
Both field and city ours, he never stood <EOS>
To ease his breast with panting. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Worthy man! <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
He cannot but with measure fit the honours <EOS>
Which we devise him. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Our spoils he kick'd at, <EOS>
And look'd upon things precious as they were <EOS>
The common muck of the world: he covets less <EOS>
Than misery itself would give; rewards <EOS>
His deeds with doing them, and is content <EOS>
To spend the time to end it. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
He's right noble: <EOS>
Let him be call'd for. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Call Coriolanus. <EOS>
Officer: <EOS>
He doth appear. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased <EOS>
To make thee consul. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I do owe them still <EOS>
My life and services. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
It then remains <EOS>
That you do speak to the people. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I do beseech you, <EOS>
Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot <EOS>
Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them, <EOS>
For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you <EOS>
That I may pass this doing. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Sir, the people <EOS>
Must have their voices; neither will they bate <EOS>
One jot of ceremony. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Put them not to't: <EOS>
Pray you, go fit you to the custom and <EOS>
Take to you, as your predecessors have, <EOS>
Your honour with your form. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
It is apart <EOS>
That I shall blush in acting, and might well <EOS>
Be taken from the people. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Mark you that? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus; <EOS>
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, <EOS>
As if I had received them for the hire <EOS>
Of their breath only! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Do not stand upon't. <EOS>
We recommend to you, tribunes of the people, <EOS>
Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul <EOS>
Wish we all joy and honour. <EOS>
Senators: <EOS>
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour! <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
You see how he intends to use the people. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
May they perceive's intent! He will require them, <EOS>
As if he did contemn what he requested <EOS>
Should be in them to give. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Come, we'll inform them <EOS>
Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace, <EOS>
I know, they do attend us. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
We may, sir, if we will. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a <EOS>
power that we have no power to do; for if he show us <EOS>
his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our <EOS>
tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if <EOS>
he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him <EOS>
our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is <EOS>
monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful, <EOS>
were to make a monster of the multitude: of the <EOS>
which we being members, should bring ourselves to be <EOS>
monstrous members. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
And to make us no better thought of, a little help <EOS>
will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he <EOS>
himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
We have been called so of many; not that our heads <EOS>
are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald, <EOS>
but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and <EOS>
truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of <EOS>
one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south, <EOS>
and their consent of one direct way should be at <EOS>
once to all the points o' the compass. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would <EOS>
fly? <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's <EOS>
will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but <EOS>
if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
Why that way? <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts <EOS>
melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return <EOS>
for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
You are never without your tricks: you may, you may. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
Are you all resolved to give your voices? But <EOS>
that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I <EOS>
say, if he would incline to the people, there was <EOS>
never a worthier man. <EOS>
Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his <EOS>
behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to <EOS>
come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and <EOS>
by threes. He's to make his requests by <EOS>
particulars; wherein every one of us has a single <EOS>
honour, in giving him our own voices with our own <EOS>
tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how <EOS>
you shall go by him. <EOS>
All: <EOS>
Content, content. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
O sir, you are not right: have you not known <EOS>
The worthiest men have done't? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
What must I say? <EOS>
'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring <EOS>
My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds! <EOS>
I got them in my country's service, when <EOS>
Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran <EOS>
From the noise of our own drums.' <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
O me, the gods! <EOS>
You must not speak of that: you must desire them <EOS>
To think upon you. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Think upon me! hang 'em! <EOS>
I would they would forget me, like the virtues <EOS>
Which our divines lose by 'em. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
You'll mar all: <EOS>
I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you, <EOS>
In wholesome manner. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Bid them wash their faces <EOS>
And keep their teeth clean. <EOS>
So, here comes a brace. <EOS>
You know the cause, air, of my standing here. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Mine own desert. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
Your own desert! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Ay, but not mine own desire. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
How not your own desire? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the <EOS>
poor with begging. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to <EOS>
gain by you. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship? <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
The price is to ask it kindly. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to <EOS>
show you, which shall be yours in private. Your <EOS>
good voice, sir; what say you? <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
You shall ha' it, worthy sir. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices <EOS>
begged. I have your alms: adieu. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
But this is something odd. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your <EOS>
voices that I may be consul, I have here the <EOS>
customary gown. <EOS>
Fourth Citizen: <EOS>
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you <EOS>
have not deserved nobly. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Your enigma? <EOS>
Fourth Citizen: <EOS>
You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have <EOS>
been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved <EOS>
the common people. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
You should account me the more virtuous that I have <EOS>
not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my <EOS>
sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer <EOS>
estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account <EOS>
gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is <EOS>
rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise <EOS>
the insinuating nod and be off to them most <EOS>
counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the <EOS>
bewitchment of some popular man and give it <EOS>
bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you, <EOS>
I may be consul. <EOS>
Fifth Citizen: <EOS>
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give <EOS>
you our voices heartily. <EOS>
Fourth Citizen: <EOS>
You have received many wounds for your country. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I <EOS>
will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further. <EOS>
Both Citizens: <EOS>
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Most sweet voices! <EOS>
Better it is to die, better to starve, <EOS>
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve. <EOS>
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here, <EOS>
To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear, <EOS>
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't: <EOS>
What custom wills, in all things should we do't, <EOS>
The dust on antique time would lie unswept, <EOS>
And mountainous error be too highly heapt <EOS>
For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so, <EOS>
Let the high office and the honour go <EOS>
To one that would do thus. I am half through; <EOS>
The one part suffer'd, the other will I do. <EOS>
Here come more voices. <EOS>
Your voices: for your voices I have fought; <EOS>
Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear <EOS>
Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six <EOS>
I have seen and heard of; for your voices have <EOS>
Done many things, some less, some more your voices: <EOS>
Indeed I would be consul. <EOS>
Sixth Citizen: <EOS>
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest <EOS>
man's voice. <EOS>
Seventh Citizen: <EOS>
Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy, <EOS>
and make him good friend to the people! <EOS>
All Citizens: <EOS>
Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Worthy voices! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes <EOS>
Endue you with the people's voice: remains <EOS>
That, in the official marks invested, you <EOS>
Anon do meet the senate. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Is this done? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
The custom of request you have discharged: <EOS>
The people do admit you, and are summon'd <EOS>
To meet anon, upon your approbation. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Where? at the senate-house? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
There, Coriolanus. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
May I change these garments? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
You may, sir. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again, <EOS>
Repair to the senate-house. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I'll keep you company. Will you along? <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
We stay here for the people. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Fare you well. <EOS>
He has it now, and by his looks methink <EOS>
'Tis warm at 's heart. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds. <EOS>
will you dismiss the people? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
How now, my masters! have you chose this man? <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
He has our voices, sir. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice, <EOS>
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
Certainly <EOS>
He flouted us downright. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says <EOS>
He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us <EOS>
His marks of merit, wounds received for's country. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Why, so he did, I am sure. <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
No, no; no man saw 'em. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
He said he had wounds, which he could show <EOS>
in private; <EOS>
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn, <EOS>
'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom, <EOS>
But by your voices, will not so permit me; <EOS>
Your voices therefore.' When we granted that, <EOS>
Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you: <EOS>
Your most sweet voices: now you have left <EOS>
your voices, <EOS>
I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Why either were you ignorant to see't, <EOS>
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness <EOS>
To yield your voices? <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Could you not have told him <EOS>
As you were lesson'd, when he had no power, <EOS>
But was a petty servant to the state, <EOS>
He was your enemy, ever spake against <EOS>
Your liberties and the charters that you bear <EOS>
I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving <EOS>
A place of potency and sway o' the state, <EOS>
If he should still malignantly remain <EOS>
Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might <EOS>
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said <EOS>
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less <EOS>
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature <EOS>
Would think upon you for your voices and <EOS>
Translate his malice towards you into love, <EOS>
Standing your friendly lord. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Thus to have said, <EOS>
As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit <EOS>
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd <EOS>
Either his gracious promise, which you might, <EOS>
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to <EOS>
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature, <EOS>
Which easily endures not article <EOS>
Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage, <EOS>
You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler <EOS>
And pass'd him unelected. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Did you perceive <EOS>
He did solicit you in free contempt <EOS>
When he did need your loves, and do you think <EOS>
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you, <EOS>
When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies <EOS>
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry <EOS>
Against the rectorship of judgment? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Have you <EOS>
Ere now denied the asker? and now again <EOS>
Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow <EOS>
Your sued-for tongues? <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
And will deny him: <EOS>
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends, <EOS>
They have chose a consul that will from them take <EOS>
Their liberties; make them of no more voice <EOS>
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking <EOS>
As therefore kept to do so. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Let them assemble, <EOS>
And on a safer judgment all revoke <EOS>
Your ignorant election; enforce his pride, <EOS>
And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not <EOS>
With what contempt he wore the humble weed, <EOS>
How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves, <EOS>
Thinking upon his services, took from you <EOS>
The apprehension of his present portance, <EOS>
Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion <EOS>
After the inveterate hate he bears you. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Lay <EOS>
A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured, <EOS>
No impediment between, but that you must <EOS>
Cast your election on him. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Say, you chose him <EOS>
More after our commandment than as guided <EOS>
By your own true affections, and that your minds, <EOS>
Preoccupied with what you rather must do <EOS>
Than what you should, made you against the grain <EOS>
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you. <EOS>
How youngly he began to serve his country, <EOS>
How long continued, and what stock he springs of, <EOS>
The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came <EOS>
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son, <EOS>
Who, after great Hostilius, here was king; <EOS>
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were, <EOS>
That our beat water brought by conduits hither; <EOS>
And <EOS>
Twice being <EOS>
Was his great ancestor. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
One thus descended, <EOS>
That hath beside well in his person wrought <EOS>
To be set high in place, we did commend <EOS>
To your remembrances: but you have found, <EOS>
Scaling his present bearing with his past, <EOS>
That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke <EOS>
Your sudden approbation. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Say, you ne'er had done't-- <EOS>
Harp on that still--but by our putting on; <EOS>
And presently, when you have drawn your number, <EOS>
Repair to the Capitol. <EOS>
All: <EOS>
We will so: almost all <EOS>
Repent in their election. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Let them go on; <EOS>
This mutiny were better put in hazard, <EOS>
Than stay, past doubt, for greater: <EOS>
If, as his nature is, he fall in rage <EOS>
With their refusal, both observe and answer <EOS>
The vantage of his anger. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
To the Capitol, come: <EOS>
We will be there before the stream o' the people; <EOS>
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own, <EOS>
Which we have goaded onward. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head? <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
He had, my lord; and that it was which caused <EOS>
Our swifter composition. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
So then the Volsces stand but as at first, <EOS>
Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road. <EOS>
Upon's again. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
They are worn, lord consul, so, <EOS>
That we shall hardly in our ages see <EOS>
Their banners wave again. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Saw you Aufidius? <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse <EOS>
Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely <EOS>
Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Spoke he of me? <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
He did, my lord. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
How? what? <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
How often he had met you, sword to sword; <EOS>
That of all things upon the earth he hated <EOS>
Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes <EOS>
To hopeless restitution, so he might <EOS>
Be call'd your vanquisher. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
At Antium lives he? <EOS>
LARTIUS: <EOS>
At Antium. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, <EOS>
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home. <EOS>
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, <EOS>
The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them; <EOS>
For they do prank them in authority, <EOS>
Against all noble sufferance. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Pass no further. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Ha! what is that? <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
It will be dangerous to go on: no further. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
What makes this change? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
The matter? <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common? <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Cominius, no. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Have I had children's voices? <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
The people are incensed against him. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Stop, <EOS>
Or all will fall in broil. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Are these your herd? <EOS>
Must these have voices, that can yield them now <EOS>
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are <EOS>
your offices? <EOS>
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth? <EOS>
Have you not set them on? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Be calm, be calm. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot, <EOS>
To curb the will of the nobility: <EOS>
Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule <EOS>
Nor ever will be ruled. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Call't not a plot: <EOS>
The people cry you mock'd them, and of late, <EOS>
When corn was given them gratis, you repined; <EOS>
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them <EOS>
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Why, this was known before. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Not to them all. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Have you inform'd them sithence? <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
How! I inform them! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
You are like to do such business. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Not unlike, <EOS>
Each way, to better yours. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds, <EOS>
Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me <EOS>
Your fellow tribune. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
You show too much of that <EOS>
For which the people stir: if you will pass <EOS>
To where you are bound, you must inquire your way, <EOS>
Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit, <EOS>
Or never be so noble as a consul, <EOS>
Nor yoke with him for tribune. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Let's be calm. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
The people are abused; set on. This paltering <EOS>
Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus <EOS>
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely <EOS>
I' the plain way of his merit. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Tell me of corn! <EOS>
This was my speech, and I will speak't again-- <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Not now, not now. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Not in this heat, sir, now. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends, <EOS>
I crave their pardons: <EOS>
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them <EOS>
Regard me as I do not flatter, and <EOS>
Therein behold themselves: I say again, <EOS>
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate <EOS>
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, <EOS>
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, <EOS>
and scatter'd, <EOS>
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number, <EOS>
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that <EOS>
Which they have given to beggars. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Well, no more. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
No more words, we beseech you. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
How! no more! <EOS>
As for my country I have shed my blood, <EOS>
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs <EOS>
Coin words till their decay against those measles, <EOS>
Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought <EOS>
The very way to catch them. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
You speak o' the people, <EOS>
As if you were a god to punish, not <EOS>
A man of their infirmity. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
'Twere well <EOS>
We let the people know't. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
What, what? his choler? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Choler! <EOS>
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, <EOS>
By Jove, 'twould be my mind! <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
It is a mind <EOS>
That shall remain a poison where it is, <EOS>
Not poison any further. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Shall remain! <EOS>
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you <EOS>
His absolute 'shall'? <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
'Twas from the canon. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
'Shall'! <EOS>
O good but most unwise patricians! why, <EOS>
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus <EOS>
Given Hydra here to choose an officer, <EOS>
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but <EOS>
The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit <EOS>
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch, <EOS>
And make your channel his? If he have power <EOS>
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake <EOS>
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd, <EOS>
Be not as common fools; if you are not, <EOS>
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians, <EOS>
If they be senators: and they are no less, <EOS>
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste <EOS>
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate, <EOS>
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,' <EOS>
His popular 'shall' against a graver bench <EOS>
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself! <EOS>
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches <EOS>
To know, when two authorities are up, <EOS>
Neither supreme, how soon confusion <EOS>
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take <EOS>
The one by the other. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Well, on to the market-place. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth <EOS>
The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used <EOS>
Sometime in Greece,-- <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Well, well, no more of that. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Though there the people had more absolute power, <EOS>
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed <EOS>
The ruin of the state. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Why, shall the people give <EOS>
One that speaks thus their voice? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I'll give my reasons, <EOS>
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn <EOS>
Was not our recompense, resting well assured <EOS>
That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war, <EOS>
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd, <EOS>
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service <EOS>
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war <EOS>
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd <EOS>
Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation <EOS>
Which they have often made against the senate, <EOS>
All cause unborn, could never be the motive <EOS>
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then? <EOS>
How shall this bisson multitude digest <EOS>
The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express <EOS>
What's like to be their words: 'we did request it; <EOS>
We are the greater poll, and in true fear <EOS>
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase <EOS>
The nature of our seats and make the rabble <EOS>
Call our cares fears; which will in time <EOS>
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in <EOS>
The crows to peck the eagles. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Come, enough. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Enough, with over-measure. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
No, take more: <EOS>
What may be sworn by, both divine and human, <EOS>
Seal what I end withal! This double worship, <EOS>
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other <EOS>
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom, <EOS>
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no <EOS>
Of general ignorance,--it must omit <EOS>
Real necessities, and give way the while <EOS>
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd, <EOS>
it follows, <EOS>
Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,-- <EOS>
You that will be less fearful than discreet, <EOS>
That love the fundamental part of state <EOS>
More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer <EOS>
A noble life before a long, and wish <EOS>
To jump a body with a dangerous physic <EOS>
That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out <EOS>
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick <EOS>
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour <EOS>
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state <EOS>
Of that integrity which should become't, <EOS>
Not having the power to do the good it would, <EOS>
For the in which doth control't. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Has said enough. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer <EOS>
As traitors do. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee! <EOS>
What should the people do with these bald tribunes? <EOS>
On whom depending, their obedience fails <EOS>
To the greater bench: in a rebellion, <EOS>
When what's not meet, but what must be, was law, <EOS>
Then were they chosen: in a better hour, <EOS>
Let what is meet be said it must be meet, <EOS>
And throw their power i' the dust. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Manifest treason! <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
This a consul? no. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
The aediles, ho! <EOS>
Let him be apprehended. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Go, call the people: <EOS>
in whose name myself <EOS>
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator, <EOS>
A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee, <EOS>
And follow to thine answer. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Hence, old goat! <EOS>
Senators, &C: <EOS>
We'll surety him. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Aged sir, hands off. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones <EOS>
Out of thy garments. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Help, ye citizens! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
On both sides more respect. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Here's he that would take from you all your power. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Seize him, AEdiles! <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
Down with him! down with him! <EOS>
Senators, &C: <EOS>
Weapons, weapons, weapons! <EOS>
'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!' <EOS>
'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!' <EOS>
'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!' <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
What is about to be? I am out of breath; <EOS>
Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes <EOS>
To the people! Coriolanus, patience! <EOS>
Speak, good Sicinius. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Hear me, people; peace! <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
You are at point to lose your liberties: <EOS>
Marcius would have all from you; Marcius, <EOS>
Whom late you have named for consul. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Fie, fie, fie! <EOS>
This is the way to kindle, not to quench. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
What is the city but the people? <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
True, <EOS>
The people are the city. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
By the consent of all, we were establish'd <EOS>
The people's magistrates. <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
You so remain. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
And so are like to do. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
That is the way to lay the city flat; <EOS>
To bring the roof to the foundation, <EOS>
And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges, <EOS>
In heaps and piles of ruin. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
This deserves death. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Or let us stand to our authority, <EOS>
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce, <EOS>
Upon the part o' the people, in whose power <EOS>
We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy <EOS>
Of present death. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Therefore lay hold of him; <EOS>
Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence <EOS>
Into destruction cast him. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
AEdiles, seize him! <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
Yield, Marcius, yield! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Hear me one word; <EOS>
Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word. <EOS>
AEdile: <EOS>
Peace, peace! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Sir, those cold ways, <EOS>
That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous <EOS>
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him, <EOS>
And bear him to the rock. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
No, I'll die here. <EOS>
There's some among you have beheld me fighting: <EOS>
Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Lay hands upon him. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Help Marcius, help, <EOS>
You that be noble; help him, young and old! <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
Down with him, down with him! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Go, get you to your house; be gone, away! <EOS>
All will be naught else. <EOS>
Second Senator: <EOS>
Get you gone. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Stand fast; <EOS>
We have as many friends as enemies. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Sham it be put to that? <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
The gods forbid! <EOS>
I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house; <EOS>
Leave us to cure this cause. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
For 'tis a sore upon us, <EOS>
You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Come, sir, along with us. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I would they were barbarians--as they are, <EOS>
Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not, <EOS>
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol-- <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Be gone; <EOS>
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue; <EOS>
One time will owe another. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
On fair ground <EOS>
I could beat forty of them. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
I could myself <EOS>
Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the <EOS>
two tribunes: <EOS>
But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic; <EOS>
And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands <EOS>
Against a falling fabric. Will you hence, <EOS>
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend <EOS>
Like interrupted waters and o'erbear <EOS>
What they are used to bear. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Pray you, be gone: <EOS>
I'll try whether my old wit be in request <EOS>
With those that have but little: this must be patch'd <EOS>
With cloth of any colour. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Nay, come away. <EOS>
A Patrician: <EOS>
This man has marr'd his fortune. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
His nature is too noble for the world: <EOS>
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident, <EOS>
Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth: <EOS>
What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent; <EOS>
And, being angry, does forget that ever <EOS>
He heard the name of death. <EOS>
Here's goodly work! <EOS>
Second Patrician: <EOS>
I would they were abed! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance! <EOS>
Could he not speak 'em fair? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Where is this viper <EOS>
That would depopulate the city and <EOS>
Be every man himself? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
You worthy tribunes,-- <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock <EOS>
With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law, <EOS>
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial <EOS>
Than the severity of the public power <EOS>
Which he so sets at nought. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
He shall well know <EOS>
The noble tribunes are the people's mouths, <EOS>
And we their hands. <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
He shall, sure on't. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Sir, sir,-- <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Peace! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt <EOS>
With modest warrant. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Sir, how comes't that you <EOS>
Have holp to make this rescue? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Hear me speak: <EOS>
As I do know the consul's worthiness, <EOS>
So can I name his faults,-- <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Consul! what consul? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
The consul Coriolanus. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
He consul! <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
No, no, no, no, no. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people, <EOS>
I may be heard, I would crave a word or two; <EOS>
The which shall turn you to no further harm <EOS>
Than so much loss of time. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Speak briefly then; <EOS>
For we are peremptory to dispatch <EOS>
This viperous traitor: to eject him hence <EOS>
Were but one danger, and to keep him here <EOS>
Our certain death: therefore it is decreed <EOS>
He dies to-night. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Now the good gods forbid <EOS>
That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude <EOS>
Towards her deserved children is enroll'd <EOS>
In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam <EOS>
Should now eat up her own! <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
He's a disease that must be cut away. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
O, he's a limb that has but a disease; <EOS>
Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy. <EOS>
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death? <EOS>
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost-- <EOS>
Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath, <EOS>
By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country; <EOS>
And what is left, to lose it by his country, <EOS>
Were to us all, that do't and suffer it, <EOS>
A brand to the end o' the world. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
This is clean kam. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Merely awry: when he did love his country, <EOS>
It honour'd him. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
The service of the foot <EOS>
Being once gangrened, is not then respected <EOS>
For what before it was. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
We'll hear no more. <EOS>
Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence: <EOS>
Lest his infection, being of catching nature, <EOS>
Spread further. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
One word more, one word. <EOS>
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find <EOS>
The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late <EOS>
Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process; <EOS>
Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out, <EOS>
And sack great Rome with Romans. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
If it were so,-- <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
What do ye talk? <EOS>
Have we not had a taste of his obedience? <EOS>
Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars <EOS>
Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd <EOS>
In bolted language; meal and bran together <EOS>
He throws without distinction. Give me leave, <EOS>
I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him <EOS>
Where he shall answer, by a lawful form, <EOS>
In peace, to his utmost peril. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Noble tribunes, <EOS>
It is the humane way: the other course <EOS>
Will prove too bloody, and the end of it <EOS>
Unknown to the beginning. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Noble Menenius, <EOS>
Be you then as the people's officer. <EOS>
Masters, lay down your weapons. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Go not home. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there: <EOS>
Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed <EOS>
In our first way. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I'll bring him to you. <EOS>
Let me desire your company: he must come, <EOS>
Or what is worst will follow. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Pray you, let's to him. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Let them puff all about mine ears, present me <EOS>
Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels, <EOS>
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock, <EOS>
That the precipitation might down stretch <EOS>
Below the beam of sight, yet will I still <EOS>
Be thus to them. <EOS>
A Patrician: <EOS>
You do the nobler. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I muse my mother <EOS>
Does not approve me further, who was wont <EOS>
To call them woollen vassals, things created <EOS>
To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads <EOS>
In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder, <EOS>
When one but of my ordinance stood up <EOS>
To speak of peace or war. <EOS>
I talk of you: <EOS>
Why did you wish me milder? would you have me <EOS>
False to my nature? Rather say I play <EOS>
The man I am. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
O, sir, sir, sir, <EOS>
I would have had you put your power well on, <EOS>
Before you had worn it out. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Let go. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
You might have been enough the man you are, <EOS>
With striving less to be so; lesser had been <EOS>
The thwartings of your dispositions, if <EOS>
You had not show'd them how ye were disposed <EOS>
Ere they lack'd power to cross you. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Let them hang. <EOS>
A Patrician: <EOS>
Ay, and burn too. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Come, come, you have been too rough, something <EOS>
too rough; <EOS>
You must return and mend it. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
There's no remedy; <EOS>
Unless, by not so doing, our good city <EOS>
Cleave in the midst, and perish. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Pray, be counsell'd: <EOS>
I have a heart as little apt as yours, <EOS>
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger <EOS>
To better vantage. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Well said, noble woman? <EOS>
Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that <EOS>
The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic <EOS>
For the whole state, I would put mine armour on, <EOS>
Which I can scarcely bear. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
What must I do? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Return to the tribunes. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Well, what then? what then? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Repent what you have spoke. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
For them! I cannot do it to the gods; <EOS>
Must I then do't to them? <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
You are too absolute; <EOS>
Though therein you can never be too noble, <EOS>
But when extremities speak. I have heard you say, <EOS>
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends, <EOS>
I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me, <EOS>
In peace what each of them by the other lose, <EOS>
That they combine not there. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Tush, tush! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
A good demand. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
If it be honour in your wars to seem <EOS>
The same you are not, which, for your best ends, <EOS>
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse, <EOS>
That it shall hold companionship in peace <EOS>
With honour, as in war, since that to both <EOS>
It stands in like request? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Why force you this? <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Because that now it lies you on to speak <EOS>
To the people; not by your own instruction, <EOS>
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you, <EOS>
But with such words that are but rooted in <EOS>
Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables <EOS>
Of no allowance to your bosom's truth. <EOS>
Now, this no more dishonours you at all <EOS>
Than to take in a town with gentle words, <EOS>
Which else would put you to your fortune and <EOS>
The hazard of much blood. <EOS>
I would dissemble with my nature where <EOS>
My fortunes and my friends at stake required <EOS>
I should do so in honour: I am in this, <EOS>
Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles; <EOS>
And you will rather show our general louts <EOS>
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em, <EOS>
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard <EOS>
Of what that want might ruin. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Noble lady! <EOS>
Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so, <EOS>
Not what is dangerous present, but the loss <EOS>
Of what is past. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
I prithee now, my son, <EOS>
Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand; <EOS>
And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them-- <EOS>
Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business <EOS>
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant <EOS>
More learned than the ears--waving thy head, <EOS>
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart, <EOS>
Now humble as the ripest mulberry <EOS>
That will not hold the handling: or say to them, <EOS>
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils <EOS>
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess, <EOS>
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim, <EOS>
In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame <EOS>
Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far <EOS>
As thou hast power and person. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
This but done, <EOS>
Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours; <EOS>
For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free <EOS>
As words to little purpose. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Prithee now, <EOS>
Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather <EOS>
Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf <EOS>
Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit <EOS>
You make strong party, or defend yourself <EOS>
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Only fair speech. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
I think 'twill serve, if he <EOS>
Can thereto frame his spirit. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
He must, and will <EOS>
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce? <EOS>
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart <EOS>
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't: <EOS>
Yet, were there but this single plot to lose, <EOS>
This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it <EOS>
And throw't against the wind. To the market-place! <EOS>
You have put me now to such a part which never <EOS>
I shall discharge to the life. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Come, come, we'll prompt you. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said <EOS>
My praises made thee first a soldier, so, <EOS>
To have my praise for this, perform a part <EOS>
Thou hast not done before. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Well, I must do't: <EOS>
Away, my disposition, and possess me <EOS>
Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd, <EOS>
Which quired with my drum, into a pipe <EOS>
Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice <EOS>
That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves <EOS>
Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up <EOS>
The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue <EOS>
Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees, <EOS>
Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his <EOS>
That hath received an alms! I will not do't, <EOS>
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth <EOS>
And by my body's action teach my mind <EOS>
A most inherent baseness. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
At thy choice, then: <EOS>
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour <EOS>
Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let <EOS>
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear <EOS>
Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death <EOS>
With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list <EOS>
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me, <EOS>
But owe thy pride thyself. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Pray, be content: <EOS>
Mother, I am going to the market-place; <EOS>
Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves, <EOS>
Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved <EOS>
Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going: <EOS>
Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul; <EOS>
Or never trust to what my tongue can do <EOS>
I' the way of flattery further. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Do your will. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself <EOS>
To answer mildly; for they are prepared <EOS>
With accusations, as I hear, more strong <EOS>
Than are upon you yet. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go: <EOS>
Let them accuse me by invention, I <EOS>
Will answer in mine honour. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Ay, but mildly. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Well, mildly be it then. Mildly! <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
In this point charge him home, that he affects <EOS>
Tyrannical power: if he evade us there, <EOS>
Enforce him with his envy to the people, <EOS>
And that the spoil got on the Antiates <EOS>
Was ne'er distributed. <EOS>
What, will he come? <EOS>
AEdile: <EOS>
He's coming. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
How accompanied? <EOS>
AEdile: <EOS>
With old Menenius, and those senators <EOS>
That always favour'd him. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Have you a catalogue <EOS>
Of all the voices that we have procured <EOS>
Set down by the poll? <EOS>
AEdile: <EOS>
I have; 'tis ready. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Have you collected them by tribes? <EOS>
AEdile: <EOS>
I have. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Assemble presently the people hither; <EOS>
And when they bear me say 'It shall be so <EOS>
I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either <EOS>
For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them <EOS>
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.' <EOS>
Insisting on the old prerogative <EOS>
And power i' the truth o' the cause. <EOS>
AEdile: <EOS>
I shall inform them. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
And when such time they have begun to cry, <EOS>
Let them not cease, but with a din confused <EOS>
Enforce the present execution <EOS>
Of what we chance to sentence. <EOS>
AEdile: <EOS>
Very well. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Make them be strong and ready for this hint, <EOS>
When we shall hap to give 't them. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Go about it. <EOS>
Put him to choler straight: he hath been used <EOS>
Ever to conquer, and to have his worth <EOS>
Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot <EOS>
Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks <EOS>
What's in his heart; and that is there which looks <EOS>
With us to break his neck. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Well, here he comes. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Calmly, I do beseech you. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece <EOS>
Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods <EOS>
Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice <EOS>
Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's! <EOS>
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace, <EOS>
And not our streets with war! <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Amen, amen. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
A noble wish. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Draw near, ye people. <EOS>
AEdile: <EOS>
List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
First, hear me speak. <EOS>
Both Tribunes: <EOS>
Well, say. Peace, ho! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Shall I be charged no further than this present? <EOS>
Must all determine here? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
I do demand, <EOS>
If you submit you to the people's voices, <EOS>
Allow their officers and are content <EOS>
To suffer lawful censure for such faults <EOS>
As shall be proved upon you? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I am content. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Lo, citizens, he says he is content: <EOS>
The warlike service he has done, consider; think <EOS>
Upon the wounds his body bears, which show <EOS>
Like graves i' the holy churchyard. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Scratches with briers, <EOS>
Scars to move laughter only. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Consider further, <EOS>
That when he speaks not like a citizen, <EOS>
You find him like a soldier: do not take <EOS>
His rougher accents for malicious sounds, <EOS>
But, as I say, such as become a soldier, <EOS>
Rather than envy you. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Well, well, no more. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
What is the matter <EOS>
That being pass'd for consul with full voice, <EOS>
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour <EOS>
You take it off again? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Answer to us. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
We charge you, that you have contrived to take <EOS>
From Rome all season'd office and to wind <EOS>
Yourself into a power tyrannical; <EOS>
For which you are a traitor to the people. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
How! traitor! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Nay, temperately; your promise. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people! <EOS>
Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune! <EOS>
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths, <EOS>
In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in <EOS>
Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say <EOS>
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free <EOS>
As I do pray the gods. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Mark you this, people? <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
To the rock, to the rock with him! <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Peace! <EOS>
We need not put new matter to his charge: <EOS>
What you have seen him do and heard him speak, <EOS>
Beating your officers, cursing yourselves, <EOS>
Opposing laws with strokes and here defying <EOS>
Those whose great power must try him; even this, <EOS>
So criminal and in such capital kind, <EOS>
Deserves the extremest death. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
But since he hath <EOS>
Served well for Rome,-- <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
What do you prate of service? <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
I talk of that, that know it. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
You? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Is this the promise that you made your mother? <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Know, I pray you,-- <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I know no further: <EOS>
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death, <EOS>
Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger <EOS>
But with a grain a day, I would not buy <EOS>
Their mercy at the price of one fair word; <EOS>
Nor cheque my courage for what they can give, <EOS>
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.' <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
For that he has, <EOS>
As much as in him lies, from time to time <EOS>
Envied against the people, seeking means <EOS>
To pluck away their power, as now at last <EOS>
Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence <EOS>
Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers <EOS>
That do distribute it; in the name o' the people <EOS>
And in the power of us the tribunes, we, <EOS>
Even from this instant, banish him our city, <EOS>
In peril of precipitation <EOS>
From off the rock Tarpeian never more <EOS>
To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name, <EOS>
I say it shall be so. <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away: <EOS>
He's banish'd, and it shall be so. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,-- <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
He's sentenced; no more hearing. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Let me speak: <EOS>
I have been consul, and can show for Rome <EOS>
Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love <EOS>
My country's good with a respect more tender, <EOS>
More holy and profound, than mine own life, <EOS>
My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase, <EOS>
And treasure of my loins; then if I would <EOS>
Speak that,-- <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
We know your drift: speak what? <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd, <EOS>
As enemy to the people and his country: <EOS>
It shall be so. <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
It shall be so, it shall be so. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate <EOS>
As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize <EOS>
As the dead carcasses of unburied men <EOS>
That do corrupt my air, I banish you; <EOS>
And here remain with your uncertainty! <EOS>
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts! <EOS>
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes, <EOS>
Fan you into despair! Have the power still <EOS>
To banish your defenders; till at length <EOS>
Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, <EOS>
Making not reservation of yourselves, <EOS>
Still your own foes, deliver you as most <EOS>
Abated captives to some nation <EOS>
That won you without blows! Despising, <EOS>
For you, the city, thus I turn my back: <EOS>
There is a world elsewhere. <EOS>
AEdile: <EOS>
The people's enemy is gone, is gone! <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo! <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Go, see him out at gates, and follow him, <EOS>
As he hath followed you, with all despite; <EOS>
Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard <EOS>
Attend us through the city. <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come. <EOS>
The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast <EOS>
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother, <EOS>
Where is your ancient courage? you were used <EOS>
To say extremity was the trier of spirits; <EOS>
That common chances common men could bear; <EOS>
That when the sea was calm all boats alike <EOS>
Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows, <EOS>
When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves <EOS>
A noble cunning: you were used to load me <EOS>
With precepts that would make invincible <EOS>
The heart that conn'd them. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
O heavens! O heavens! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Nay! prithee, woman,-- <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome, <EOS>
And occupations perish! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
What, what, what! <EOS>
I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother. <EOS>
Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say, <EOS>
If you had been the wife of Hercules, <EOS>
Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved <EOS>
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius, <EOS>
Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother: <EOS>
I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius, <EOS>
Thy tears are salter than a younger man's, <EOS>
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general, <EOS>
I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld <EOS>
Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women <EOS>
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes, <EOS>
As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well <EOS>
My hazards still have been your solace: and <EOS>
Believe't not lightly--though I go alone, <EOS>
Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen <EOS>
Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son <EOS>
Will or exceed the common or be caught <EOS>
With cautelous baits and practise. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
My first son. <EOS>
Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius <EOS>
With thee awhile: determine on some course, <EOS>
More than a wild exposture to each chance <EOS>
That starts i' the way before thee. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
O the gods! <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee <EOS>
Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us <EOS>
And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth <EOS>
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send <EOS>
O'er the vast world to seek a single man, <EOS>
And lose advantage, which doth ever cool <EOS>
I' the absence of the needer. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Fare ye well: <EOS>
Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full <EOS>
Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one <EOS>
That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate. <EOS>
Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and <EOS>
My friends of noble touch, when I am forth, <EOS>
Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come. <EOS>
While I remain above the ground, you shall <EOS>
Hear from me still, and never of me aught <EOS>
But what is like me formerly. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
That's worthily <EOS>
As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep. <EOS>
If I could shake off but one seven years <EOS>
From these old arms and legs, by the good gods, <EOS>
I'ld with thee every foot. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Give me thy hand: Come. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further. <EOS>
The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided <EOS>
In his behalf. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Now we have shown our power, <EOS>
Let us seem humbler after it is done <EOS>
Than when it was a-doing. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Bid them home: <EOS>
Say their great enemy is gone, and they <EOS>
Stand in their ancient strength. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Dismiss them home. <EOS>
Here comes his mother. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Let's not meet her. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Why? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
They say she's mad. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods <EOS>
Requite your love! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Peace, peace; be not so loud. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
If that I could for weeping, you should hear,-- <EOS>
Nay, and you shall hear some. <EOS>
Will you be gone? <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Are you mankind? <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool. <EOS>
Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship <EOS>
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome <EOS>
Than thou hast spoken words? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
O blessed heavens! <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
More noble blows than ever thou wise words; <EOS>
And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go: <EOS>
Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son <EOS>
Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him, <EOS>
His good sword in his hand. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
What then? <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
What then! <EOS>
He'ld make an end of thy posterity. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Bastards and all. <EOS>
Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Come, come, peace. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
I would he had continued to his country <EOS>
As he began, and not unknit himself <EOS>
The noble knot he made. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
I would he had. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble: <EOS>
Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth <EOS>
As I can of those mysteries which heaven <EOS>
Will not have earth to know. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Pray, let us go. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Now, pray, sir, get you gone: <EOS>
You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:-- <EOS>
As far as doth the Capitol exceed <EOS>
The meanest house in Rome, so far my son-- <EOS>
This lady's husband here, this, do you see-- <EOS>
Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Well, well, we'll leave you. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Why stay we to be baited <EOS>
With one that wants her wits? <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Take my prayers with you. <EOS>
I would the gods had nothing else to do <EOS>
But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em <EOS>
But once a-day, it would unclog my heart <EOS>
Of what lies heavy to't. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
You have told them home; <EOS>
And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me? <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself, <EOS>
And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go: <EOS>
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do, <EOS>
In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Fie, fie, fie! <EOS>
Roman: <EOS>
I know you well, sir, and you know <EOS>
me: your name, I think, is Adrian. <EOS>
Volsce: <EOS>
It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you. <EOS>
Roman: <EOS>
I am a Roman; and my services are, <EOS>
as you are, against 'em: know you me yet? <EOS>
Volsce: <EOS>
Nicanor? no. <EOS>
Roman: <EOS>
The same, sir. <EOS>
Volsce: <EOS>
You had more beard when I last saw you; but your <EOS>
favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the <EOS>
news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state, <EOS>
to find you out there: you have well saved me a <EOS>
day's journey. <EOS>
Roman: <EOS>
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the <EOS>
people against the senators, patricians, and nobles. <EOS>
Volsce: <EOS>
Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not <EOS>
so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and <EOS>
hope to come upon them in the heat of their division. <EOS>
Roman: <EOS>
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing <EOS>
would make it flame again: for the nobles receive <EOS>
so to heart the banishment of that worthy <EOS>
Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take <EOS>
all power from the people and to pluck from them <EOS>
their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can <EOS>
tell you, and is almost mature for the violent <EOS>
breaking out. <EOS>
Volsce: <EOS>
Coriolanus banished! <EOS>
Roman: <EOS>
Banished, sir. <EOS>
Volsce: <EOS>
You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor. <EOS>
Roman: <EOS>
The day serves well for them now. I have heard it <EOS>
said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is <EOS>
when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble <EOS>
Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his <EOS>
great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request <EOS>
of his country. <EOS>
Volsce: <EOS>
He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus <EOS>
accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my <EOS>
business, and I will merrily accompany you home. <EOS>
Roman: <EOS>
I shall, between this and supper, tell you most <EOS>
strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of <EOS>
their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you? <EOS>
Volsce: <EOS>
A most royal one; the centurions and their charges, <EOS>
distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment, <EOS>
and to be on foot at an hour's warning. <EOS>
Roman: <EOS>
I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the <EOS>
man, I think, that shall set them in present action. <EOS>
So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company. <EOS>
Volsce: <EOS>
You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause <EOS>
to be glad of yours. <EOS>
Roman: <EOS>
Well, let us go together. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
A goodly city is this Antium. City, <EOS>
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir <EOS>
Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars <EOS>
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not, <EOS>
Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones <EOS>
In puny battle slay me. <EOS>
Save you, sir. <EOS>
Citizen: <EOS>
And you. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Direct me, if it be your will, <EOS>
Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium? <EOS>
Citizen: <EOS>
He is, and feasts the nobles of the state <EOS>
At his house this night. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Which is his house, beseech you? <EOS>
Citizen: <EOS>
This, here before you. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Thank you, sir: farewell. <EOS>
O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn, <EOS>
Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart, <EOS>
Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise, <EOS>
Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love <EOS>
Unseparable, shall within this hour, <EOS>
On a dissension of a doit, break out <EOS>
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes, <EOS>
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep, <EOS>
To take the one the other, by some chance, <EOS>
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends <EOS>
And interjoin their issues. So with me: <EOS>
My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon <EOS>
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me, <EOS>
He does fair justice; if he give me way, <EOS>
I'll do his country service. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
Wine, wine, wine! What service <EOS>
is here! I think our fellows are asleep. <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
Where's Cotus? my master calls <EOS>
for him. Cotus! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I <EOS>
Appear not like a guest. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
What would you have, friend? whence are you? <EOS>
Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I have deserved no better entertainment, <EOS>
In being Coriolanus. <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his <EOS>
head; that he gives entrance to such companions? <EOS>
Pray, get you out. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Away! <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
Away! get you away. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Now thou'rt troublesome. <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
What fellow's this? <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him <EOS>
out of the house: prithee, call my master to him. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid <EOS>
the house. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
What are you? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
A gentleman. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
A marvellous poor one. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
True, so I am. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other <EOS>
station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a <EOS>
strange guest he has here. <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
And I shall. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
Where dwellest thou? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Under the canopy. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
Under the canopy! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Ay. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
Where's that? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I' the city of kites and crows. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is! <EOS>
Then thou dwellest with daws too? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
No, I serve not thy master. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
How, sir! do you meddle with my master? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy <EOS>
mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy <EOS>
trencher, hence! <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Where is this fellow? <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for <EOS>
disturbing the lords within. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name? <EOS>
Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
If, Tullus, <EOS>
Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not <EOS>
Think me for the man I am, necessity <EOS>
Commands me name myself. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
What is thy name? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, <EOS>
And harsh in sound to thine. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Say, what's thy name? <EOS>
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face <EOS>
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn. <EOS>
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st <EOS>
thou me yet? <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
I know thee not: thy name? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done <EOS>
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces <EOS>
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may <EOS>
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service, <EOS>
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood <EOS>
Shed for my thankless country are requited <EOS>
But with that surname; a good memory, <EOS>
And witness of the malice and displeasure <EOS>
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains; <EOS>
The cruelty and envy of the people, <EOS>
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who <EOS>
Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest; <EOS>
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be <EOS>
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity <EOS>
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope-- <EOS>
Mistake me not--to save my life, for if <EOS>
I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world <EOS>
I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite, <EOS>
To be full quit of those my banishers, <EOS>
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast <EOS>
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge <EOS>
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims <EOS>
Of shame seen through thy country, speed <EOS>
thee straight, <EOS>
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it <EOS>
That my revengeful services may prove <EOS>
As benefits to thee, for I will fight <EOS>
Against my canker'd country with the spleen <EOS>
Of all the under fiends. But if so be <EOS>
Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes <EOS>
Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am <EOS>
Longer to live most weary, and present <EOS>
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice; <EOS>
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool, <EOS>
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate, <EOS>
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast, <EOS>
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless <EOS>
It be to do thee service. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
O Marcius, Marcius! <EOS>
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart <EOS>
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter <EOS>
Should from yond cloud speak divine things, <EOS>
And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more <EOS>
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine <EOS>
Mine arms about that body, where against <EOS>
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke <EOS>
And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip <EOS>
The anvil of my sword, and do contest <EOS>
As hotly and as nobly with thy love <EOS>
As ever in ambitious strength I did <EOS>
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first, <EOS>
I loved the maid I married; never man <EOS>
Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here, <EOS>
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart <EOS>
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw <EOS>
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee, <EOS>
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose <EOS>
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn, <EOS>
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out <EOS>
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since <EOS>
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me; <EOS>
We have been down together in my sleep, <EOS>
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat, <EOS>
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius, <EOS>
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that <EOS>
Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all <EOS>
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war <EOS>
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, <EOS>
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in, <EOS>
And take our friendly senators by the hands; <EOS>
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me, <EOS>
Who am prepared against your territories, <EOS>
Though not for Rome itself. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
You bless me, gods! <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have <EOS>
The leading of thine own revenges, take <EOS>
The one half of my commission; and set down-- <EOS>
As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st <EOS>
Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways; <EOS>
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome, <EOS>
Or rudely visit them in parts remote, <EOS>
To fright them, ere destroy. But come in: <EOS>
Let me commend thee first to those that shall <EOS>
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes! <EOS>
And more a friend than e'er an enemy; <EOS>
Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome! <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
Here's a strange alteration! <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with <EOS>
a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a <EOS>
false report of him. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
What an arm he has! he turned me about with his <EOS>
finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top. <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in <EOS>
him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I <EOS>
cannot tell how to term it. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged, <EOS>
but I thought there was more in him than I could think. <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest <EOS>
man i' the world. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on. <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
Who, my master? <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
Nay, it's no matter for that. <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
Worth six on him. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the <EOS>
greater soldier. <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that: <EOS>
for the defence of a town, our general is excellent. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
Ay, and for an assault too. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals! <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
What, what, what? let's partake. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as <EOS>
lieve be a condemned man. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
Wherefore? wherefore? <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general, <EOS>
Caius Marcius. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
Why do you say 'thwack our general '? <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always <EOS>
good enough for him. <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too <EOS>
hard for him; I have heard him say so himself. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth <EOS>
on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched <EOS>
him like a carbon ado. <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
An he had been cannibally given, he might have <EOS>
broiled and eaten him too. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
But, more of thy news? <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son <EOS>
and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no <EOS>
question asked him by any of the senators, but they <EOS>
stand bald before him: our general himself makes a <EOS>
mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and <EOS>
turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But <EOS>
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i' <EOS>
the middle and but one half of what he was <EOS>
yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty <EOS>
and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says, <EOS>
and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he <EOS>
will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled. <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as <EOS>
many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it <EOS>
were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as <EOS>
we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
Directitude! what's that? <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again, <EOS>
and the man in blood, they will out of their <EOS>
burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with <EOS>
him. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
But when goes this forward? <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the <EOS>
drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a <EOS>
parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they <EOS>
wipe their lips. <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
Why, then we shall have a stirring world again. <EOS>
This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase <EOS>
tailors, and breed ballad-makers. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as <EOS>
day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and <EOS>
full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; <EOS>
mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more <EOS>
bastard children than war's a destroyer of men. <EOS>
Second Servingman: <EOS>
'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to <EOS>
be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a <EOS>
great maker of cuckolds. <EOS>
First Servingman: <EOS>
Ay, and it makes men hate one another. <EOS>
Third Servingman: <EOS>
Reason; because they then less need one another. <EOS>
The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap <EOS>
as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising. <EOS>
All: <EOS>
In, in, in, in! <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
We hear not of him, neither need we fear him; <EOS>
His remedies are tame i' the present peace <EOS>
And quietness of the people, which before <EOS>
Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends <EOS>
Blush that the world goes well, who rather had, <EOS>
Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold <EOS>
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see <EOS>
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going <EOS>
About their functions friendly. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
We stood to't in good time. <EOS>
Is this Menenius? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late. <EOS>
Both Tribunes: <EOS>
Hail sir! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Hail to you both! <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Your Coriolanus <EOS>
Is not much miss'd, but with his friends: <EOS>
The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do, <EOS>
Were he more angry at it. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
All's well; and might have been much better, if <EOS>
He could have temporized. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Where is he, hear you? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife <EOS>
Hear nothing from him. <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
The gods preserve you both! <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
God-den, our neighbours. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
God-den to you all, god-den to you all. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees, <EOS>
Are bound to pray for you both. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Live, and thrive! <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus <EOS>
Had loved you as we did. <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
Now the gods keep you! <EOS>
Both Tribunes: <EOS>
Farewell, farewell. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
This is a happier and more comely time <EOS>
Than when these fellows ran about the streets, <EOS>
Crying confusion. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Caius Marcius was <EOS>
A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent, <EOS>
O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, <EOS>
Self-loving,-- <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
And affecting one sole throne, <EOS>
Without assistance. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I think not so. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
We should by this, to all our lamentation, <EOS>
If he had gone forth consul, found it so. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
The gods have well prevented it, and Rome <EOS>
Sits safe and still without him. <EOS>
AEdile: <EOS>
Worthy tribunes, <EOS>
There is a slave, whom we have put in prison, <EOS>
Reports, the Volsces with two several powers <EOS>
Are enter'd in the Roman territories, <EOS>
And with the deepest malice of the war <EOS>
Destroy what lies before 'em. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
'Tis Aufidius, <EOS>
Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment, <EOS>
Thrusts forth his horns again into the world; <EOS>
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome, <EOS>
And durst not once peep out. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Come, what talk you <EOS>
Of Marcius? <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be <EOS>
The Volsces dare break with us. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Cannot be! <EOS>
We have record that very well it can, <EOS>
And three examples of the like have been <EOS>
Within my age. But reason with the fellow, <EOS>
Before you punish him, where he heard this, <EOS>
Lest you shall chance to whip your information <EOS>
And beat the messenger who bids beware <EOS>
Of what is to be dreaded. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Tell not me: <EOS>
I know this cannot be. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Not possible. <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
The nobles in great earnestness are going <EOS>
All to the senate-house: some news is come <EOS>
That turns their countenances. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
'Tis this slave;-- <EOS>
Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising; <EOS>
Nothing but his report. <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Yes, worthy sir, <EOS>
The slave's report is seconded; and more, <EOS>
More fearful, is deliver'd. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
What more fearful? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
It is spoke freely out of many mouths-- <EOS>
How probable I do not know--that Marcius, <EOS>
Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome, <EOS>
And vows revenge as spacious as between <EOS>
The young'st and oldest thing. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
This is most likely! <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish <EOS>
Good Marcius home again. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
The very trick on't. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
This is unlikely: <EOS>
He and Aufidius can no more atone <EOS>
Than violentest contrariety. <EOS>
Second Messenger: <EOS>
You are sent for to the senate: <EOS>
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius <EOS>
Associated with Aufidius, rages <EOS>
Upon our territories; and have already <EOS>
O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took <EOS>
What lay before them. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
O, you have made good work! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
What news? what news? <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
You have holp to ravish your own daughters and <EOS>
To melt the city leads upon your pates, <EOS>
To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,-- <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
What's the news? what's the news? <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Your temples burned in their cement, and <EOS>
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined <EOS>
Into an auger's bore. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Pray now, your news? <EOS>
You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?-- <EOS>
If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,-- <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
If! <EOS>
He is their god: he leads them like a thing <EOS>
Made by some other deity than nature, <EOS>
That shapes man better; and they follow him, <EOS>
Against us brats, with no less confidence <EOS>
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies, <EOS>
Or butchers killing flies. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
You have made good work, <EOS>
You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much <EOS>
on the voice of occupation and <EOS>
The breath of garlic-eaters! <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
He will shake <EOS>
Your Rome about your ears. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
As Hercules <EOS>
Did shake down mellow fruit. <EOS>
You have made fair work! <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
But is this true, sir? <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Ay; and you'll look pale <EOS>
Before you find it other. All the regions <EOS>
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist <EOS>
Are mock'd for valiant ignorance, <EOS>
And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him? <EOS>
Your enemies and his find something in him. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
We are all undone, unless <EOS>
The noble man have mercy. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Who shall ask it? <EOS>
The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people <EOS>
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf <EOS>
Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they <EOS>
Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even <EOS>
As those should do that had deserved his hate, <EOS>
And therein show'd like enemies. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
'Tis true: <EOS>
If he were putting to my house the brand <EOS>
That should consume it, I have not the face <EOS>
To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands, <EOS>
You and your crafts! you have crafted fair! <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
You have brought <EOS>
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never <EOS>
So incapable of help. <EOS>
Both Tribunes: <EOS>
Say not we brought it. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts <EOS>
And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters, <EOS>
Who did hoot him out o' the city. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
But I fear <EOS>
They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius, <EOS>
The second name of men, obeys his points <EOS>
As if he were his officer: desperation <EOS>
Is all the policy, strength and defence, <EOS>
That Rome can make against them. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Here come the clusters. <EOS>
And is Aufidius with him? You are they <EOS>
That made the air unwholesome, when you cast <EOS>
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at <EOS>
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming; <EOS>
And not a hair upon a soldier's head <EOS>
Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs <EOS>
As you threw caps up will he tumble down, <EOS>
And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter; <EOS>
if he could burn us all into one coal, <EOS>
We have deserved it. <EOS>
Citizens: <EOS>
Faith, we hear fearful news. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
For mine own part, <EOS>
When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
And so did I. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very <EOS>
many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and <EOS>
though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet <EOS>
it was against our will. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Ye re goodly things, you voices! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
You have made <EOS>
Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol? <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
O, ay, what else? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd: <EOS>
These are a side that would be glad to have <EOS>
This true which they so seem to fear. Go home, <EOS>
And show no sign of fear. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home. <EOS>
I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished <EOS>
him. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
So did we all. But, come, let's home. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
I do not like this news. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Nor I. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth <EOS>
Would buy this for a lie! <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Pray, let us go. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Do they still fly to the Roman? <EOS>
Lieutenant: <EOS>
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but <EOS>
Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat, <EOS>
Their talk at table, and their thanks at end; <EOS>
And you are darken'd in this action, sir, <EOS>
Even by your own. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
I cannot help it now, <EOS>
Unless, by using means, I lame the foot <EOS>
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier, <EOS>
Even to my person, than I thought he would <EOS>
When first I did embrace him: yet his nature <EOS>
In that's no changeling; and I must excuse <EOS>
What cannot be amended. <EOS>
Lieutenant: <EOS>
Yet I wish, sir,-- <EOS>
I mean for your particular,--you had not <EOS>
Join'd in commission with him; but either <EOS>
Had borne the action of yourself, or else <EOS>
To him had left it solely. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
I understand thee well; and be thou sure, <EOS>
when he shall come to his account, he knows not <EOS>
What I can urge against him. Although it seems, <EOS>
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent <EOS>
To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly. <EOS>
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state, <EOS>
Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon <EOS>
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone <EOS>
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine, <EOS>
Whene'er we come to our account. <EOS>
Lieutenant: <EOS>
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome? <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
All places yield to him ere he sits down; <EOS>
And the nobility of Rome are his: <EOS>
The senators and patricians love him too: <EOS>
The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people <EOS>
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty <EOS>
To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome <EOS>
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it <EOS>
By sovereignty of nature. First he was <EOS>
A noble servant to them; but he could not <EOS>
Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride, <EOS>
Which out of daily fortune ever taints <EOS>
The happy man; whether defect of judgment, <EOS>
To fail in the disposing of those chances <EOS>
Which he was lord of; or whether nature, <EOS>
Not to be other than one thing, not moving <EOS>
From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace <EOS>
Even with the same austerity and garb <EOS>
As he controll'd the war; but one of these-- <EOS>
As he hath spices of them all, not all, <EOS>
For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd, <EOS>
So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit, <EOS>
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues <EOS>
Lie in the interpretation of the time: <EOS>
And power, unto itself most commendable, <EOS>
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair <EOS>
To extol what it hath done. <EOS>
One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail; <EOS>
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail. <EOS>
Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine, <EOS>
Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said <EOS>
Which was sometime his general; who loved him <EOS>
In a most dear particular. He call'd me father: <EOS>
But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him; <EOS>
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee <EOS>
The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd <EOS>
To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
He would not seem to know me. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Do you hear? <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
Yet one time he did call me by my name: <EOS>
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops <EOS>
That we have bled together. Coriolanus <EOS>
He would not answer to: forbad all names; <EOS>
He was a kind of nothing, titleless, <EOS>
Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire <EOS>
Of burning Rome. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Why, so: you have made good work! <EOS>
A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome, <EOS>
To make coals cheap,--a noble memory! <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon <EOS>
When it was less expected: he replied, <EOS>
It was a bare petition of a state <EOS>
To one whom they had punish'd. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Very well: <EOS>
Could he say less? <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
I offer'd to awaken his regard <EOS>
For's private friends: his answer to me was, <EOS>
He could not stay to pick them in a pile <EOS>
Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly, <EOS>
For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt, <EOS>
And still to nose the offence. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
For one poor grain or two! <EOS>
I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child, <EOS>
And this brave fellow too, we are the grains: <EOS>
You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt <EOS>
Above the moon: we must be burnt for you. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid <EOS>
In this so never-needed help, yet do not <EOS>
Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you <EOS>
Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, <EOS>
More than the instant army we can make, <EOS>
Might stop our countryman. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
No, I'll not meddle. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Pray you, go to him. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
What should I do? <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
Only make trial what your love can do <EOS>
For Rome, towards Marcius. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Well, and say that Marcius <EOS>
Return me, as Cominius is return'd, <EOS>
Unheard; what then? <EOS>
But as a discontented friend, grief-shot <EOS>
With his unkindness? say't be so? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Yet your good will <EOS>
must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure <EOS>
As you intended well. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I'll undertake 't: <EOS>
I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip <EOS>
And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me. <EOS>
He was not taken well; he had not dined: <EOS>
The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then <EOS>
We pout upon the morning, are unapt <EOS>
To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd <EOS>
These and these conveyances of our blood <EOS>
With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls <EOS>
Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him <EOS>
Till he be dieted to my request, <EOS>
And then I'll set upon him. <EOS>
BRUTUS: <EOS>
You know the very road into his kindness, <EOS>
And cannot lose your way. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Good faith, I'll prove him, <EOS>
Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge <EOS>
Of my success. <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
He'll never hear him. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Not? <EOS>
COMINIUS: <EOS>
I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye <EOS>
Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury <EOS>
The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him; <EOS>
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me <EOS>
Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do, <EOS>
He sent in writing after me; what he would not, <EOS>
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions: <EOS>
So that all hope is vain. <EOS>
Unless his noble mother, and his wife; <EOS>
Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him <EOS>
For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence, <EOS>
And with our fair entreaties haste them on. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Stay: whence are you? <EOS>
Second Senator: <EOS>
Stand, and go back. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave, <EOS>
I am an officer of state, and come <EOS>
To speak with Coriolanus. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
From whence? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
From Rome. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
You may not pass, you must return: our general <EOS>
Will no more hear from thence. <EOS>
Second Senator: <EOS>
You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before <EOS>
You'll speak with Coriolanus. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Good my friends, <EOS>
If you have heard your general talk of Rome, <EOS>
And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks, <EOS>
My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name <EOS>
Is not here passable. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I tell thee, fellow, <EOS>
The general is my lover: I have been <EOS>
The book of his good acts, whence men have read <EOS>
His name unparallel'd, haply amplified; <EOS>
For I have ever verified my friends, <EOS>
Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity <EOS>
Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes, <EOS>
Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground, <EOS>
I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise <EOS>
Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow, <EOS>
I must have leave to pass. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his <EOS>
behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you <EOS>
should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous <EOS>
to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, <EOS>
always factionary on the party of your general. <EOS>
Second Senator: <EOS>
Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you <EOS>
have, I am one that, telling true under him, must <EOS>
say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not <EOS>
speak with him till after dinner. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
You are a Roman, are you? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I am, as thy general is. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you, <EOS>
when you have pushed out your gates the very <EOS>
defender of them, and, in a violent popular <EOS>
ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to <EOS>
front his revenges with the easy groans of old <EOS>
women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with <EOS>
the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as <EOS>
you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the <EOS>
intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with <EOS>
such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived; <EOS>
therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your <EOS>
execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn <EOS>
you out of reprieve and pardon. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would <EOS>
use me with estimation. <EOS>
Second Senator: <EOS>
Come, my captain knows you not. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I mean, thy general. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest <EOS>
I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's <EOS>
the utmost of your having: back. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Nay, but, fellow, fellow,-- <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
What's the matter? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you: <EOS>
You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall <EOS>
perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from <EOS>
my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment <EOS>
with him, if thou standest not i' the state of <EOS>
hanging, or of some death more long in <EOS>
spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now <EOS>
presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee. <EOS>
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy <EOS>
particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than <EOS>
thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son! <EOS>
thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's <EOS>
water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to <EOS>
thee; but being assured none but myself could move <EOS>
thee, I have been blown out of your gates with <EOS>
sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy <EOS>
petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy <EOS>
wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet <EOS>
here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my <EOS>
access to thee. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Away! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
How! away! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs <EOS>
Are servanted to others: though I owe <EOS>
My revenge properly, my remission lies <EOS>
In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar, <EOS>
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather <EOS>
Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone. <EOS>
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than <EOS>
Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee, <EOS>
Take this along; I writ it for thy sake <EOS>
And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius, <EOS>
I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius, <EOS>
Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st! <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
You keep a constant temper. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Now, sir, is your name Menenius? <EOS>
Second Senator: <EOS>
'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the <EOS>
way home again. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your <EOS>
greatness back? <EOS>
Second Senator: <EOS>
What cause, do you think, I have to swoon? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I neither care for the world nor your general: for <EOS>
such things as you, I can scarce think there's any, <EOS>
ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by <EOS>
himself fears it not from another: let your general <EOS>
do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and <EOS>
your misery increase with your age! I say to you, <EOS>
as I was said to, Away! <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
A noble fellow, I warrant him. <EOS>
Second Senator: <EOS>
The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the <EOS>
oak not to be wind-shaken. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow <EOS>
Set down our host. My partner in this action, <EOS>
You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly <EOS>
I have borne this business. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Only their ends <EOS>
You have respected; stopp'd your ears against <EOS>
The general suit of Rome; never admitted <EOS>
A private whisper, no, not with such friends <EOS>
That thought them sure of you. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
This last old man, <EOS>
Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome, <EOS>
Loved me above the measure of a father; <EOS>
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge <EOS>
Was to send him; for whose old love I have, <EOS>
Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd <EOS>
The first conditions, which they did refuse <EOS>
And cannot now accept; to grace him only <EOS>
That thought he could do more, a very little <EOS>
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits, <EOS>
Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter <EOS>
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this? <EOS>
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow <EOS>
In the same time 'tis made? I will not. <EOS>
My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould <EOS>
Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand <EOS>
The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection! <EOS>
All bond and privilege of nature, break! <EOS>
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate. <EOS>
What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes, <EOS>
Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not <EOS>
Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows; <EOS>
As if Olympus to a molehill should <EOS>
In supplication nod: and my young boy <EOS>
Hath an aspect of intercession, which <EOS>
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces <EOS>
Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never <EOS>
Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand, <EOS>
As if a man were author of himself <EOS>
And knew no other kin. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
My lord and husband! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed <EOS>
Makes you think so. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Like a dull actor now, <EOS>
I have forgot my part, and I am out, <EOS>
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh, <EOS>
Forgive my tyranny; but do not say <EOS>
For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss <EOS>
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge! <EOS>
Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss <EOS>
I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip <EOS>
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate, <EOS>
And the most noble mother of the world <EOS>
Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth; <EOS>
Of thy deep duty more impression show <EOS>
Than that of common sons. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
O, stand up blest! <EOS>
Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint, <EOS>
I kneel before thee; and unproperly <EOS>
Show duty, as mistaken all this while <EOS>
Between the child and parent. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
What is this? <EOS>
Your knees to me? to your corrected son? <EOS>
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach <EOS>
Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds <EOS>
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun; <EOS>
Murdering impossibility, to make <EOS>
What cannot be, slight work. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Thou art my warrior; <EOS>
I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady? <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
The noble sister of Publicola, <EOS>
The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle <EOS>
That's curdied by the frost from purest snow <EOS>
And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria! <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
This is a poor epitome of yours, <EOS>
Which by the interpretation of full time <EOS>
May show like all yourself. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
The god of soldiers, <EOS>
With the consent of supreme Jove, inform <EOS>
Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove <EOS>
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars <EOS>
Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw, <EOS>
And saving those that eye thee! <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Your knee, sirrah. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
That's my brave boy! <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself, <EOS>
Are suitors to you. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I beseech you, peace: <EOS>
Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before: <EOS>
The thing I have forsworn to grant may never <EOS>
Be held by you denials. Do not bid me <EOS>
Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate <EOS>
Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not <EOS>
Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not <EOS>
To ally my rages and revenges with <EOS>
Your colder reasons. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
O, no more, no more! <EOS>
You have said you will not grant us any thing; <EOS>
For we have nothing else to ask, but that <EOS>
Which you deny already: yet we will ask; <EOS>
That, if you fail in our request, the blame <EOS>
May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll <EOS>
Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request? <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment <EOS>
And state of bodies would bewray what life <EOS>
We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself <EOS>
How more unfortunate than all living women <EOS>
Are we come hither: since that thy sight, <EOS>
which should <EOS>
Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance <EOS>
with comforts, <EOS>
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow; <EOS>
Making the mother, wife and child to see <EOS>
The son, the husband and the father tearing <EOS>
His country's bowels out. And to poor we <EOS>
Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us <EOS>
Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort <EOS>
That all but we enjoy; for how can we, <EOS>
Alas, how can we for our country pray. <EOS>
Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory, <EOS>
Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose <EOS>
The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person, <EOS>
Our comfort in the country. We must find <EOS>
An evident calamity, though we had <EOS>
Our wish, which side should win: for either thou <EOS>
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led <EOS>
With manacles thorough our streets, or else <EOS>
triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin, <EOS>
And bear the palm for having bravely shed <EOS>
Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son, <EOS>
I purpose not to wait on fortune till <EOS>
These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee <EOS>
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts <EOS>
Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner <EOS>
March to assault thy country than to tread-- <EOS>
Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb, <EOS>
That brought thee to this world. <EOS>
VIRGILIA: <EOS>
Ay, and mine, <EOS>
That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name <EOS>
Living to time. <EOS>
Young MARCIUS: <EOS>
A' shall not tread on me; <EOS>
I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Not of a woman's tenderness to be, <EOS>
Requires nor child nor woman's face to see. <EOS>
I have sat too long. <EOS>
VOLUMNIA: <EOS>
Nay, go not from us thus. <EOS>
If it were so that our request did tend <EOS>
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy <EOS>
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us, <EOS>
As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit <EOS>
Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces <EOS>
May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans, <EOS>
'This we received;' and each in either side <EOS>
Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest <EOS>
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son, <EOS>
The end of war's uncertain, but this certain, <EOS>
That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit <EOS>
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name, <EOS>
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses; <EOS>
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble, <EOS>
But with his last attempt he wiped it out; <EOS>
Destroy'd his country, and his name remains <EOS>
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son: <EOS>
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour, <EOS>
To imitate the graces of the gods; <EOS>
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air, <EOS>
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt <EOS>
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak? <EOS>
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man <EOS>
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you: <EOS>
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy: <EOS>
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more <EOS>
Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world <EOS>
More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate <EOS>
Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life <EOS>
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy, <EOS>
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood, <EOS>
Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home, <EOS>
Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust, <EOS>
And spurn me back: but if it be not so, <EOS>
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee, <EOS>
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which <EOS>
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away: <EOS>
Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees. <EOS>
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride <EOS>
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end; <EOS>
This is the last: so we will home to Rome, <EOS>
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's: <EOS>
This boy, that cannot tell what he would have <EOS>
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship, <EOS>
Does reason our petition with more strength <EOS>
Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go: <EOS>
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother; <EOS>
His wife is in Corioli and his child <EOS>
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch: <EOS>
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire, <EOS>
And then I'll speak a little. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
O mother, mother! <EOS>
What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope, <EOS>
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene <EOS>
They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O! <EOS>
You have won a happy victory to Rome; <EOS>
But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it, <EOS>
Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd, <EOS>
If not most mortal to him. But, let it come. <EOS>
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars, <EOS>
I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius, <EOS>
Were you in my stead, would you have heard <EOS>
A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius? <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
I was moved withal. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
I dare be sworn you were: <EOS>
And, sir, it is no little thing to make <EOS>
Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir, <EOS>
What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part, <EOS>
I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you, <EOS>
Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife! <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Ay, by and by; <EOS>
But we will drink together; and you shall bear <EOS>
A better witness back than words, which we, <EOS>
On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd. <EOS>
Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve <EOS>
To have a temple built you: all the swords <EOS>
In Italy, and her confederate arms, <EOS>
Could not have made this peace. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond <EOS>
corner-stone? <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Why, what of that? <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
If it be possible for you to displace it with your <EOS>
little finger, there is some hope the ladies of <EOS>
Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him. <EOS>
But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are <EOS>
sentenced and stay upon execution. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Is't possible that so short a time can alter the <EOS>
condition of a man! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly; <EOS>
yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown <EOS>
from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a <EOS>
creeping thing. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
He loved his mother dearly. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother <EOS>
now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness <EOS>
of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he <EOS>
moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before <EOS>
his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with <EOS>
his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a <EOS>
battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for <EOS>
Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with <EOS>
his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity <EOS>
and a heaven to throne in. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Yes, mercy, if you report him truly. <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his <EOS>
mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy <EOS>
in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that <EOS>
shall our poor city find: and all this is long of <EOS>
you. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
The gods be good unto us! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto <EOS>
us. When we banished him, we respected not them; <EOS>
and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us. <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house: <EOS>
The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune <EOS>
And hale him up and down, all swearing, if <EOS>
The Roman ladies bring not comfort home, <EOS>
They'll give him death by inches. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
What's the news? <EOS>
Second Messenger: <EOS>
Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd, <EOS>
The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone: <EOS>
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome, <EOS>
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
Friend, <EOS>
Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain? <EOS>
Second Messenger: <EOS>
As certain as I know the sun is fire: <EOS>
Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it? <EOS>
Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide, <EOS>
As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you! <EOS>
The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes, <EOS>
Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans, <EOS>
Make the sun dance. Hark you! <EOS>
MENENIUS: <EOS>
This is good news: <EOS>
I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia <EOS>
Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians, <EOS>
A city full; of tribunes, such as you, <EOS>
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day: <EOS>
This morning for ten thousand of your throats <EOS>
I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy! <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next, <EOS>
Accept my thankfulness. <EOS>
Second Messenger: <EOS>
Sir, we have all <EOS>
Great cause to give great thanks. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
They are near the city? <EOS>
Second Messenger: <EOS>
Almost at point to enter. <EOS>
SICINIUS: <EOS>
We will meet them, <EOS>
And help the joy. <EOS>
First Senator: <EOS>
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome! <EOS>
Call all your tribes together, praise the gods, <EOS>
And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them: <EOS>
Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius, <EOS>
Repeal him with the welcome of his mother; <EOS>
Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!' <EOS>
All: <EOS>
Welcome, ladies, Welcome! <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Go tell the lords o' the city I am here: <EOS>
Deliver them this paper: having read it, <EOS>
Bid them repair to the market place; where I, <EOS>
Even in theirs and in the commons' ears, <EOS>
Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse <EOS>
The city ports by this hath enter'd and <EOS>
Intends to appear before the people, hoping <EOS>
To purge herself with words: dispatch. <EOS>
Most welcome! <EOS>
First Conspirator: <EOS>
How is it with our general? <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Even so <EOS>
As with a man by his own alms empoison'd, <EOS>
And with his charity slain. <EOS>
Second Conspirator: <EOS>
Most noble sir, <EOS>
If you do hold the same intent wherein <EOS>
You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you <EOS>
Of your great danger. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Sir, I cannot tell: <EOS>
We must proceed as we do find the people. <EOS>
Third Conspirator: <EOS>
The people will remain uncertain whilst <EOS>
'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either <EOS>
Makes the survivor heir of all. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
I know it; <EOS>
And my pretext to strike at him admits <EOS>
A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd <EOS>
Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd, <EOS>
He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery, <EOS>
Seducing so my friends; and, to this end, <EOS>
He bow'd his nature, never known before <EOS>
But to be rough, unswayable and free. <EOS>
Third Conspirator: <EOS>
Sir, his stoutness <EOS>
When he did stand for consul, which he lost <EOS>
By lack of stooping,-- <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
That I would have spoke of: <EOS>
Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth; <EOS>
Presented to my knife his throat: I took him; <EOS>
Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way <EOS>
In all his own desires; nay, let him choose <EOS>
Out of my files, his projects to accomplish, <EOS>
My best and freshest men; served his designments <EOS>
In mine own person; holp to reap the fame <EOS>
Which he did end all his; and took some pride <EOS>
To do myself this wrong: till, at the last, <EOS>
I seem'd his follower, not partner, and <EOS>
He waged me with his countenance, as if <EOS>
I had been mercenary. <EOS>
First Conspirator: <EOS>
So he did, my lord: <EOS>
The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last, <EOS>
When he had carried Rome and that we look'd <EOS>
For no less spoil than glory,-- <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
There was it: <EOS>
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him. <EOS>
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are <EOS>
As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour <EOS>
Of our great action: therefore shall he die, <EOS>
And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark! <EOS>
First Conspirator: <EOS>
Your native town you enter'd like a post, <EOS>
And had no welcomes home: but he returns, <EOS>
Splitting the air with noise. <EOS>
Second Conspirator: <EOS>
And patient fools, <EOS>
Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear <EOS>
With giving him glory. <EOS>
Third Conspirator: <EOS>
Therefore, at your vantage, <EOS>
Ere he express himself, or move the people <EOS>
With what he would say, let him feel your sword, <EOS>
Which we will second. When he lies along, <EOS>
After your way his tale pronounced shall bury <EOS>
His reasons with his body. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Say no more: <EOS>
Here come the lords. <EOS>
All The Lords: <EOS>
You are most welcome home. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
I have not deserved it. <EOS>
But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused <EOS>
What I have written to you? <EOS>
Lords: <EOS>
We have. <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
And grieve to hear't. <EOS>
What faults he made before the last, I think <EOS>
Might have found easy fines: but there to end <EOS>
Where he was to begin and give away <EOS>
The benefit of our levies, answering us <EOS>
With our own charge, making a treaty where <EOS>
There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
He approaches: you shall hear him. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier, <EOS>
No more infected with my country's love <EOS>
Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting <EOS>
Under your great command. You are to know <EOS>
That prosperously I have attempted and <EOS>
With bloody passage led your wars even to <EOS>
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home <EOS>
Do more than counterpoise a full third part <EOS>
The charges of the action. We have made peace <EOS>
With no less honour to the Antiates <EOS>
Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver, <EOS>
Subscribed by the consuls and patricians, <EOS>
Together with the seal o' the senate, what <EOS>
We have compounded on. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Read it not, noble lords; <EOS>
But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree <EOS>
He hath abused your powers. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Traitor! how now! <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Ay, traitor, Marcius! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Marcius! <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think <EOS>
I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name <EOS>
Coriolanus in Corioli? <EOS>
You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously <EOS>
He has betray'd your business, and given up, <EOS>
For certain drops of salt, your city Rome, <EOS>
I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother; <EOS>
Breaking his oath and resolution like <EOS>
A twist of rotten silk, never admitting <EOS>
Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears <EOS>
He whined and roar'd away your victory, <EOS>
That pages blush'd at him and men of heart <EOS>
Look'd wondering each at other. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Hear'st thou, Mars? <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Name not the god, thou boy of tears! <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Ha! <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
No more. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart <EOS>
Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave! <EOS>
Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever <EOS>
I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords, <EOS>
Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion-- <EOS>
Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that <EOS>
Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join <EOS>
To thrust the lie unto him. <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
Peace, both, and hear me speak. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads, <EOS>
Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound! <EOS>
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there, <EOS>
That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I <EOS>
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli: <EOS>
Alone I did it. Boy! <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Why, noble lords, <EOS>
Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune, <EOS>
Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart, <EOS>
'Fore your own eyes and ears? <EOS>
All Conspirators: <EOS>
Let him die for't. <EOS>
All The People: <EOS>
'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd <EOS>
my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin <EOS>
Marcus.' 'He killed my father.' <EOS>
Second Lord: <EOS>
Peace, ho! no outrage: peace! <EOS>
The man is noble and his fame folds-in <EOS>
This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us <EOS>
Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius, <EOS>
And trouble not the peace. <EOS>
CORIOLANUS: <EOS>
O that I had him, <EOS>
With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe, <EOS>
To use my lawful sword! <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
Insolent villain! <EOS>
All Conspirators: <EOS>
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him! <EOS>
Lords: <EOS>
Hold, hold, hold, hold! <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
My noble masters, hear me speak. <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
O Tullus,-- <EOS>
Second Lord: <EOS>
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep. <EOS>
Third Lord: <EOS>
Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet; <EOS>
Put up your swords. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage, <EOS>
Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger <EOS>
Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice <EOS>
That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours <EOS>
To call me to your senate, I'll deliver <EOS>
Myself your loyal servant, or endure <EOS>
Your heaviest censure. <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
Bear from hence his body; <EOS>
And mourn you for him: let him be regarded <EOS>
As the most noble corse that ever herald <EOS>
Did follow to his urn. <EOS>
Second Lord: <EOS>
His own impatience <EOS>
Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame. <EOS>
Let's make the best of it. <EOS>
AUFIDIUS: <EOS>
My rage is gone; <EOS>
And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up. <EOS>
Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one. <EOS>
Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully: <EOS>
Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he <EOS>
Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one, <EOS>
Which to this hour bewail the injury, <EOS>
Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Now is the winter of our discontent <EOS>
Made glorious summer by this sun of York; <EOS>
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house <EOS>
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. <EOS>
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; <EOS>
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; <EOS>
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings, <EOS>
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. <EOS>
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front; <EOS>
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds <EOS>
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries, <EOS>
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber <EOS>
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute. <EOS>
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, <EOS>
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass; <EOS>
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty <EOS>
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; <EOS>
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, <EOS>
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature, <EOS>
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time <EOS>
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up, <EOS>
And that so lamely and unfashionable <EOS>
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them; <EOS>
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace, <EOS>
Have no delight to pass away the time, <EOS>
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun <EOS>
And descant on mine own deformity: <EOS>
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover, <EOS>
To entertain these fair well-spoken days, <EOS>
I am determined to prove a villain <EOS>
And hate the idle pleasures of these days. <EOS>
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous, <EOS>
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams, <EOS>
To set my brother Clarence and the king <EOS>
In deadly hate the one against the other: <EOS>
And if King Edward be as true and just <EOS>
As I am subtle, false and treacherous, <EOS>
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up, <EOS>
About a prophecy, which says that 'G' <EOS>
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be. <EOS>
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here <EOS>
Clarence comes. <EOS>
Brother, good day; what means this armed guard <EOS>
That waits upon your grace? <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
His majesty <EOS>
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed <EOS>
This conduct to convey me to the Tower. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Upon what cause? <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Because my name is George. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours; <EOS>
He should, for that, commit your godfathers: <EOS>
O, belike his majesty hath some intent <EOS>
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower. <EOS>
But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know? <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest <EOS>
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn, <EOS>
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams; <EOS>
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G. <EOS>
And says a wizard told him that by G <EOS>
His issue disinherited should be; <EOS>
And, for my name of George begins with G, <EOS>
It follows in his thought that I am he. <EOS>
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these <EOS>
Have moved his highness to commit me now. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women: <EOS>
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower: <EOS>
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she <EOS>
That tempers him to this extremity. <EOS>
Was it not she and that good man of worship, <EOS>
Anthony Woodville, her brother there, <EOS>
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower, <EOS>
From whence this present day he is deliver'd? <EOS>
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
By heaven, I think there's no man is secure <EOS>
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds <EOS>
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore. <EOS>
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant <EOS>
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Humbly complaining to her deity <EOS>
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty. <EOS>
I'll tell you what; I think it is our way, <EOS>
If we will keep in favour with the king, <EOS>
To be her men and wear her livery: <EOS>
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself, <EOS>
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen. <EOS>
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy. <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
I beseech your graces both to pardon me; <EOS>
His majesty hath straitly given in charge <EOS>
That no man shall have private conference, <EOS>
Of what degree soever, with his brother. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury, <EOS>
You may partake of any thing we say: <EOS>
We speak no treason, man: we say the king <EOS>
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen <EOS>
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous; <EOS>
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot, <EOS>
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue; <EOS>
And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks: <EOS>
How say you sir? Can you deny all this? <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
With this, my lord, myself have nought to do. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow, <EOS>
He that doth naught with her, excepting one, <EOS>
Were best he do it secretly, alone. <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
What one, my lord? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me? <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal <EOS>
Forbear your conference with the noble duke. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
We are the queen's abjects, and must obey. <EOS>
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king; <EOS>
And whatsoever you will employ me in, <EOS>
Were it to call King Edward's widow sister, <EOS>
I will perform it to enfranchise you. <EOS>
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood <EOS>
Touches me deeper than you can imagine. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
I know it pleaseth neither of us well. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long; <EOS>
Meantime, have patience. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
I must perforce. Farewell. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return. <EOS>
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so, <EOS>
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven, <EOS>
If heaven will take the present at our hands. <EOS>
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings? <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Good time of day unto my gracious lord! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
As much unto my good lord chamberlain! <EOS>
Well are you welcome to the open air. <EOS>
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment? <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must: <EOS>
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks <EOS>
That were the cause of my imprisonment. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too; <EOS>
For they that were your enemies are his, <EOS>
And have prevail'd as much on him as you. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
More pity that the eagle should be mew'd, <EOS>
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
What news abroad? <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
No news so bad abroad as this at home; <EOS>
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy, <EOS>
And his physicians fear him mightily. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed. <EOS>
O, he hath kept an evil diet long, <EOS>
And overmuch consumed his royal person: <EOS>
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon. <EOS>
What, is he in his bed? <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
He is. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Go you before, and I will follow you. <EOS>
He cannot live, I hope; and must not die <EOS>
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven. <EOS>
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence, <EOS>
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments; <EOS>
And, if I fall not in my deep intent, <EOS>
Clarence hath not another day to live: <EOS>
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy, <EOS>
And leave the world for me to bustle in! <EOS>
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter. <EOS>
What though I kill'd her husband and her father? <EOS>
The readiest way to make the wench amends <EOS>
Is to become her husband and her father: <EOS>
The which will I; not all so much for love <EOS>
As for another secret close intent, <EOS>
By marrying her which I must reach unto. <EOS>
But yet I run before my horse to market: <EOS>
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns: <EOS>
When they are gone, then must I count my gains. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Set down, set down your honourable load, <EOS>
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse, <EOS>
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament <EOS>
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster. <EOS>
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king! <EOS>
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster! <EOS>
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood! <EOS>
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost, <EOS>
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne, <EOS>
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son, <EOS>
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds! <EOS>
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life, <EOS>
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes. <EOS>
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes! <EOS>
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it! <EOS>
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence! <EOS>
More direful hap betide that hated wretch, <EOS>
That makes us wretched by the death of thee, <EOS>
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads, <EOS>
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives! <EOS>
If ever he have child, abortive be it, <EOS>
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light, <EOS>
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect <EOS>
May fright the hopeful mother at the view; <EOS>
And that be heir to his unhappiness! <EOS>
If ever he have wife, let her he made <EOS>
A miserable by the death of him <EOS>
As I am made by my poor lord and thee! <EOS>
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load, <EOS>
Taken from Paul's to be interred there; <EOS>
And still, as you are weary of the weight, <EOS>
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
What black magician conjures up this fiend, <EOS>
To stop devoted charitable deeds? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul, <EOS>
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys. <EOS>
Gentleman: <EOS>
My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command: <EOS>
Advance thy halbert higher than my breast, <EOS>
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot, <EOS>
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
What, do you tremble? are you all afraid? <EOS>
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal, <EOS>
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil. <EOS>
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell! <EOS>
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body, <EOS>
His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not; <EOS>
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell, <EOS>
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims. <EOS>
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds, <EOS>
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries. <EOS>
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds <EOS>
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh! <EOS>
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity; <EOS>
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood <EOS>
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells; <EOS>
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural, <EOS>
Provokes this deluge most unnatural. <EOS>
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death! <EOS>
O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death! <EOS>
Either heaven with lightning strike the <EOS>
murderer dead, <EOS>
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick, <EOS>
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood <EOS>
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Lady, you know no rules of charity, <EOS>
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man: <EOS>
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
But I know none, and therefore am no beast. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
O wonderful, when devils tell the truth! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
More wonderful, when angels are so angry. <EOS>
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman, <EOS>
Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave, <EOS>
By circumstance, but to acquit myself. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man, <EOS>
For these known evils, but to give me leave, <EOS>
By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have <EOS>
Some patient leisure to excuse myself. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make <EOS>
No excuse current, but to hang thyself. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
By such despair, I should accuse myself. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused; <EOS>
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself, <EOS>
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Say that I slew them not? <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Why, then they are not dead: <EOS>
But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I did not kill your husband. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Why, then he is alive. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw <EOS>
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood; <EOS>
The which thou once didst bend against her breast, <EOS>
But that thy brothers beat aside the point. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I was provoked by her slanderous tongue, <EOS>
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind. <EOS>
Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries: <EOS>
Didst thou not kill this king? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I grant ye. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too <EOS>
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed! <EOS>
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither; <EOS>
For he was fitter for that place than earth. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
And thou unfit for any place but hell. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Some dungeon. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Your bed-chamber. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
So will it, madam till I lie with you. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
I hope so. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne, <EOS>
To leave this keen encounter of our wits, <EOS>
And fall somewhat into a slower method, <EOS>
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths <EOS>
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward, <EOS>
As blameful as the executioner? <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Your beauty was the cause of that effect; <EOS>
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep <EOS>
To undertake the death of all the world, <EOS>
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide, <EOS>
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck; <EOS>
You should not blemish it, if I stood by: <EOS>
As all the world is cheered by the sun, <EOS>
So I by that; it is my day, my life. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
I would I were, to be revenged on thee. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
It is a quarrel most unnatural, <EOS>
To be revenged on him that loveth you. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
It is a quarrel just and reasonable, <EOS>
To be revenged on him that slew my husband. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband, <EOS>
Did it to help thee to a better husband. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
His better doth not breathe upon the earth. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
He lives that loves thee better than he could. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Name him. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Plantagenet. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Why, that was he. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
The selfsame name, but one of better nature. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Where is he? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Here. <EOS>
Why dost thou spit at me? <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Never came poison from so sweet a place. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Never hung poison on a fouler toad. <EOS>
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I would they were, that I might die at once; <EOS>
For now they kill me with a living death. <EOS>
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears, <EOS>
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops: <EOS>
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear, <EOS>
No, when my father York and Edward wept, <EOS>
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made <EOS>
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him; <EOS>
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child, <EOS>
Told the sad story of my father's death, <EOS>
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep, <EOS>
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks <EOS>
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time <EOS>
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear; <EOS>
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale, <EOS>
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping. <EOS>
I never sued to friend nor enemy; <EOS>
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word; <EOS>
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee, <EOS>
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak. <EOS>
Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made <EOS>
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt. <EOS>
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive, <EOS>
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword; <EOS>
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom. <EOS>
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee, <EOS>
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke, <EOS>
And humbly beg the death upon my knee. <EOS>
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry, <EOS>
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me. <EOS>
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward, <EOS>
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on. <EOS>
Take up the sword again, or take up me. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death, <EOS>
I will not be the executioner. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
I have already. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Tush, that was in thy rage: <EOS>
Speak it again, and, even with the word, <EOS>
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love, <EOS>
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love; <EOS>
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
I would I knew thy heart. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
'Tis figured in my tongue. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
I fear me both are false. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Then never man was true. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Well, well, put up your sword. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Say, then, my peace is made. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
That shall you know hereafter. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
But shall I live in hope? <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
All men, I hope, live so. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Vouchsafe to wear this ring. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
To take is not to give. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Look, how this ring encompasseth finger. <EOS>
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart; <EOS>
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine. <EOS>
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may <EOS>
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand, <EOS>
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
What is it? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
That it would please thee leave these sad designs <EOS>
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner, <EOS>
And presently repair to Crosby Place; <EOS>
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd <EOS>
At Chertsey monastery this noble king, <EOS>
And wet his grave with my repentant tears, <EOS>
I will with all expedient duty see you: <EOS>
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you, <EOS>
Grant me this boon. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
With all my heart; and much it joys me too, <EOS>
To see you are become so penitent. <EOS>
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Bid me farewell. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
'Tis more than you deserve; <EOS>
But since you teach me how to flatter you, <EOS>
Imagine I have said farewell already. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Sirs, take up the corse. <EOS>
GENTLEMEN: <EOS>
Towards Chertsey, noble lord? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining. <EOS>
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd? <EOS>
Was ever woman in this humour won? <EOS>
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long. <EOS>
What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father, <EOS>
To take her in her heart's extremest hate, <EOS>
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes, <EOS>
The bleeding witness of her hatred by; <EOS>
Having God, her conscience, and these bars <EOS>
against me, <EOS>
And I nothing to back my suit at all, <EOS>
But the plain devil and dissembling looks, <EOS>
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing! <EOS>
Ha! <EOS>
Hath she forgot already that brave prince, <EOS>
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since, <EOS>
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury? <EOS>
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman, <EOS>
Framed in the prodigality of nature, <EOS>
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal, <EOS>
The spacious world cannot again afford <EOS>
And will she yet debase her eyes on me, <EOS>
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince, <EOS>
And made her widow to a woful bed? <EOS>
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety? <EOS>
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus? <EOS>
My dukedom to a beggarly denier, <EOS>
I do mistake my person all this while: <EOS>
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot, <EOS>
Myself to be a marvellous proper man. <EOS>
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass, <EOS>
And entertain some score or two of tailors, <EOS>
To study fashions to adorn my body: <EOS>
Since I am crept in favour with myself, <EOS>
Will maintain it with some little cost. <EOS>
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave; <EOS>
And then return lamenting to my love. <EOS>
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass, <EOS>
That I may see my shadow as I pass. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty <EOS>
Will soon recover his accustom'd health. <EOS>
GREY: <EOS>
In that you brook it in, it makes him worse: <EOS>
Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort, <EOS>
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
If he were dead, what would betide of me? <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
No other harm but loss of such a lord. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
The loss of such a lord includes all harm. <EOS>
GREY: <EOS>
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son, <EOS>
To be your comforter when he is gone. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Oh, he is young and his minority <EOS>
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester, <EOS>
A man that loves not me, nor none of you. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
Is it concluded that he shall be protector? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
It is determined, not concluded yet: <EOS>
But so it must be, if the king miscarry. <EOS>
GREY: <EOS>
Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Good time of day unto your royal grace! <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
God make your majesty joyful as you have been! <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby. <EOS>
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen. <EOS>
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife, <EOS>
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured <EOS>
I hate not you for her proud arrogance. <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
I do beseech you, either not believe <EOS>
The envious slanders of her false accusers; <EOS>
Or, if she be accused in true report, <EOS>
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds <EOS>
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby? <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I <EOS>
Are come from visiting his majesty. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
What likelihood of his amendment, lords? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
God grant him health! Did you confer with him? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement <EOS>
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers, <EOS>
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain; <EOS>
And sent to warn them to his royal presence. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Would all were well! but that will never be <EOS>
I fear our happiness is at the highest. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it: <EOS>
Who are they that complain unto the king, <EOS>
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not? <EOS>
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly <EOS>
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours. <EOS>
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair, <EOS>
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog, <EOS>
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy, <EOS>
I must be held a rancorous enemy. <EOS>
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm, <EOS>
But thus his simple truth must be abused <EOS>
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks? <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace. <EOS>
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong? <EOS>
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction? <EOS>
A plague upon you all! His royal person,-- <EOS>
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!-- <EOS>
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while, <EOS>
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter. <EOS>
The king, of his own royal disposition, <EOS>
And not provoked by any suitor else; <EOS>
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred, <EOS>
Which in your outward actions shows itself <EOS>
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself, <EOS>
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather <EOS>
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad, <EOS>
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch: <EOS>
Since every Jack became a gentleman <EOS>
There's many a gentle person made a Jack. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother <EOS>
Gloucester; <EOS>
You envy my advancement and my friends': <EOS>
God grant we never may have need of you! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Meantime, God grants that we have need of you: <EOS>
Your brother is imprison'd by your means, <EOS>
Myself disgraced, and the nobility <EOS>
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions <EOS>
Are daily given to ennoble those <EOS>
That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
By Him that raised me to this careful height <EOS>
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd, <EOS>
I never did incense his majesty <EOS>
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been <EOS>
An earnest advocate to plead for him. <EOS>
My lord, you do me shameful injury, <EOS>
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
You may deny that you were not the cause <EOS>
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
She may, my lord, for-- <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so? <EOS>
She may do more, sir, than denying that: <EOS>
She may help you to many fair preferments, <EOS>
And then deny her aiding hand therein, <EOS>
And lay those honours on your high deserts. <EOS>
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she-- <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
What, marry, may she? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
What, marry, may she! marry with a king, <EOS>
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too: <EOS>
I wis your grandam had a worser match. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne <EOS>
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs: <EOS>
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty <EOS>
With those gross taunts I often have endured. <EOS>
I had rather be a country servant-maid <EOS>
Than a great queen, with this condition, <EOS>
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at: <EOS>
Small joy have I in being England's queen. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee! <EOS>
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
What! threat you me with telling of the king? <EOS>
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said <EOS>
I will avouch in presence of the king: <EOS>
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower. <EOS>
'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Out, devil! I remember them too well: <EOS>
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower, <EOS>
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king, <EOS>
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs; <EOS>
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries, <EOS>
A liberal rewarder of his friends: <EOS>
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Yea, and much better blood than his or thine. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
In all which time you and your husband Grey <EOS>
Were factious for the house of Lancaster; <EOS>
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband <EOS>
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain? <EOS>
Let me put in your minds, if you forget, <EOS>
What you have been ere now, and what you are; <EOS>
Withal, what I have been, and what I am. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
A murderous villain, and so still thou art. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick; <EOS>
Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!-- <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Which God revenge! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
To fight on Edward's party for the crown; <EOS>
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up. <EOS>
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's; <EOS>
Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine <EOS>
I am too childish-foolish for this world. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world, <EOS>
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days <EOS>
Which here you urge to prove us enemies, <EOS>
We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king: <EOS>
So should we you, if you should be our king. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar: <EOS>
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it! <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose <EOS>
You should enjoy, were you this country's king, <EOS>
As little joy may you suppose in me. <EOS>
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
A little joy enjoys the queen thereof; <EOS>
For I am she, and altogether joyless. <EOS>
I can no longer hold me patient. <EOS>
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out <EOS>
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me! <EOS>
Which of you trembles not that looks on me? <EOS>
If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects, <EOS>
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels? <EOS>
O gentle villain, do not turn away! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd; <EOS>
That will I make before I let thee go. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Wert thou not banished on pain of death? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
I was; but I do find more pain in banishment <EOS>
Than death can yield me here by my abode. <EOS>
A husband and a son thou owest to me; <EOS>
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance: <EOS>
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours, <EOS>
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
The curse my noble father laid on thee, <EOS>
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper <EOS>
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes, <EOS>
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout <EOS>
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland-- <EOS>
His curses, then from bitterness of soul <EOS>
Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee; <EOS>
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
So just is God, to right the innocent. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe, <EOS>
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of! <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported. <EOS>
DORSET: <EOS>
No man but prophesied revenge for it. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
What were you snarling all before I came, <EOS>
Ready to catch each other by the throat, <EOS>
And turn you all your hatred now on me? <EOS>
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven? <EOS>
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death, <EOS>
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment, <EOS>
Could all but answer for that peevish brat? <EOS>
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven? <EOS>
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses! <EOS>
If not by war, by surfeit die your king, <EOS>
As ours by murder, to make him a king! <EOS>
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales, <EOS>
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales, <EOS>
Die in his youth by like untimely violence! <EOS>
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen, <EOS>
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self! <EOS>
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss; <EOS>
And see another, as I see thee now, <EOS>
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine! <EOS>
Long die thy happy days before thy death; <EOS>
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief, <EOS>
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen! <EOS>
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by, <EOS>
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son <EOS>
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him, <EOS>
That none of you may live your natural age, <EOS>
But by some unlook'd accident cut off! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag! <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me. <EOS>
If heaven have any grievous plague in store <EOS>
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee, <EOS>
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe, <EOS>
And then hurl down their indignation <EOS>
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace! <EOS>
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul! <EOS>
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest, <EOS>
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends! <EOS>
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine, <EOS>
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream <EOS>
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils! <EOS>
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog! <EOS>
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity <EOS>
The slave of nature and the son of hell! <EOS>
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb! <EOS>
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins! <EOS>
Thou rag of honour! thou detested-- <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Margaret. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Richard! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Ha! <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
I call thee not. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought <EOS>
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply. <EOS>
O, let me make the period to my curse! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.' <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune! <EOS>
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider, <EOS>
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about? <EOS>
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself. <EOS>
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me <EOS>
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse, <EOS>
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
Were you well served, you would be taught your duty. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
To serve me well, you all should do me duty, <EOS>
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects: <EOS>
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty! <EOS>
DORSET: <EOS>
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Peace, master marquess, you are malapert: <EOS>
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current. <EOS>
O, that your young nobility could judge <EOS>
What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable! <EOS>
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them; <EOS>
And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess. <EOS>
DORSET: <EOS>
It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Yea, and much more: but I was born so high, <EOS>
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top, <EOS>
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas! <EOS>
Witness my son, now in the shade of death; <EOS>
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath <EOS>
Hath in eternal darkness folded up. <EOS>
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest. <EOS>
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it! <EOS>
As it was won with blood, lost be it so! <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Have done! for shame, if not for charity. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Urge neither charity nor shame to me: <EOS>
Uncharitably with me have you dealt, <EOS>
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd. <EOS>
My charity is outrage, life my shame <EOS>
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Have done, have done. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand, <EOS>
In sign of league and amity with thee: <EOS>
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house! <EOS>
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood, <EOS>
Nor thou within the compass of my curse. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Nor no one here; for curses never pass <EOS>
The lips of those that breathe them in the air. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
I'll not believe but they ascend the sky, <EOS>
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace. <EOS>
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog! <EOS>
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites, <EOS>
His venom tooth will rankle to the death: <EOS>
Have not to do with him, beware of him; <EOS>
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him, <EOS>
And all their ministers attend on him. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel? <EOS>
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from? <EOS>
O, but remember this another day, <EOS>
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow, <EOS>
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess! <EOS>
Live each of you the subjects to his hate, <EOS>
And he to yours, and all of you to God's! <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother, <EOS>
She hath had too much wrong; and I repent <EOS>
My part thereof that I have done to her. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
I never did her any, to my knowledge. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
But you have all the vantage of her wrong. <EOS>
I was too hot to do somebody good, <EOS>
That is too cold in thinking of it now. <EOS>
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid, <EOS>
He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains <EOS>
God pardon them that are the cause of it! <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion, <EOS>
To pray for them that have done scathe to us. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
So do I ever: <EOS>
being well-advised. <EOS>
For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself. <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
Madam, his majesty doth call for you, <EOS>
And for your grace; and you, my noble lords. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us? <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
Madam, we will attend your grace. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl. <EOS>
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach <EOS>
I lay unto the grievous charge of others. <EOS>
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness, <EOS>
I do beweep to many simple gulls <EOS>
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham; <EOS>
And say it is the queen and her allies <EOS>
That stir the king against the duke my brother. <EOS>
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me <EOS>
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: <EOS>
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture, <EOS>
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil: <EOS>
And thus I clothe my naked villany <EOS>
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ; <EOS>
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil. <EOS>
But, soft! here come my executioners. <EOS>
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates! <EOS>
Are you now going to dispatch this deed? <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant <EOS>
That we may be admitted where he is. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Well thought upon; I have it here about me. <EOS>
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place. <EOS>
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution, <EOS>
Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead; <EOS>
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps <EOS>
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Tush! <EOS>
Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate; <EOS>
Talkers are no good doers: be assured <EOS>
We come to use our hands and not our tongues. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears: <EOS>
I like you, lads; about your business straight; <EOS>
Go, go, dispatch. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
We will, my noble lord. <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
Why looks your grace so heavily today? <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
O, I have pass'd a miserable night, <EOS>
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams, <EOS>
That, as I am a Christian faithful man, <EOS>
I would not spend another such a night, <EOS>
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days, <EOS>
So full of dismal terror was the time! <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower, <EOS>
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy; <EOS>
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester; <EOS>
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk <EOS>
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England, <EOS>
And cited up a thousand fearful times, <EOS>
During the wars of York and Lancaster <EOS>
That had befall'n us. As we paced along <EOS>
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches, <EOS>
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling, <EOS>
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard, <EOS>
Into the tumbling billows of the main. <EOS>
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown! <EOS>
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears! <EOS>
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes! <EOS>
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks; <EOS>
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon; <EOS>
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, <EOS>
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, <EOS>
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea: <EOS>
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes <EOS>
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept, <EOS>
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems, <EOS>
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep, <EOS>
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by. <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
Had you such leisure in the time of death <EOS>
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep? <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Methought I had; and often did I strive <EOS>
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood <EOS>
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth <EOS>
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air; <EOS>
But smother'd it within my panting bulk, <EOS>
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea. <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
Awaked you not with this sore agony? <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life; <EOS>
O, then began the tempest to my soul, <EOS>
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood, <EOS>
With that grim ferryman which poets write of, <EOS>
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night. <EOS>
The first that there did greet my stranger soul, <EOS>
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick; <EOS>
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury <EOS>
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?' <EOS>
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by <EOS>
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair <EOS>
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud, <EOS>
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence, <EOS>
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury; <EOS>
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!' <EOS>
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends <EOS>
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears <EOS>
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise <EOS>
I trembling waked, and for a season after <EOS>
Could not believe but that I was in hell, <EOS>
Such terrible impression made the dream. <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you; <EOS>
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
O Brakenbury, I have done those things, <EOS>
Which now bear evidence against my soul, <EOS>
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me! <EOS>
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee, <EOS>
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds, <EOS>
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone, <EOS>
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children! <EOS>
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me; <EOS>
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep. <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest! <EOS>
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours, <EOS>
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night. <EOS>
Princes have but their tides for their glories, <EOS>
An outward honour for an inward toil; <EOS>
And, for unfelt imagination, <EOS>
They often feel a world of restless cares: <EOS>
So that, betwixt their tides and low names, <EOS>
There's nothing differs but the outward fame. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Ho! who's here? <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
In God's name what are you, and how came you hither? <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs. <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
Yea, are you so brief? <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show <EOS>
him our commission; talk no more. <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
I am, in this, commanded to deliver <EOS>
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands: <EOS>
I will not reason what is meant hereby, <EOS>
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning. <EOS>
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep: <EOS>
I'll to the king; and signify to him <EOS>
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
What, shall we stab him as he sleeps? <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till <EOS>
the judgment-day. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind <EOS>
of remorse in me. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
What, art thou afraid? <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be <EOS>
damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
I thought thou hadst been resolute. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
So I am, to let him live. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour <EOS>
will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one <EOS>
would tell twenty. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
How dost thou feel thyself now? <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet <EOS>
within me. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Remember our reward, when the deed is done. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Where is thy conscience now? <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
In the Duke of Gloucester's purse. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward, <EOS>
thy conscience flies out. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
How if it come to thee again? <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it <EOS>
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it <EOS>
accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him; <EOS>
he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it <EOS>
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that <EOS>
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of <EOS>
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold <EOS>
that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it <EOS>
is turned out of all towns and cities for a <EOS>
dangerous thing; and every man that means to live <EOS>
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live <EOS>
without it. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me <EOS>
not to kill the duke. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he <EOS>
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me, <EOS>
I warrant thee. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his <EOS>
reputation. Come, shall we to this gear? <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy <EOS>
sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt <EOS>
in the next room. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
O excellent devise! make a sop of him. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Hark! he stirs: shall I strike? <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
No, first let's reason with him. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine. <EOS>
Second murderer: <EOS>
You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
In God's name, what art thou? <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
A man, as you are. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
But not, as I am, royal. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
Nor you, as we are, loyal. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak! <EOS>
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale? <EOS>
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come? <EOS>
Both: <EOS>
To, to, to-- <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
To murder me? <EOS>
Both: <EOS>
Ay, ay. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so, <EOS>
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it. <EOS>
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you? <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Offended us you have not, but the king. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
I shall be reconciled to him again. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Are you call'd forth from out a world of men <EOS>
To slay the innocent? What is my offence? <EOS>
Where are the evidence that do accuse me? <EOS>
What lawful quest have given their verdict up <EOS>
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced <EOS>
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death? <EOS>
Before I be convict by course of law, <EOS>
To threaten me with death is most unlawful. <EOS>
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption <EOS>
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins, <EOS>
That you depart and lay no hands on me <EOS>
The deed you undertake is damnable. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
What we will do, we do upon command. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
And he that hath commanded is the king. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings <EOS>
Hath in the tables of his law commanded <EOS>
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then, <EOS>
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's? <EOS>
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands, <EOS>
To hurl upon their heads that break his law. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee, <EOS>
For false forswearing and for murder too: <EOS>
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament, <EOS>
To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
And, like a traitor to the name of God, <EOS>
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade <EOS>
Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us, <EOS>
When thou hast broke it in so dear degree? <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed? <EOS>
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs, <EOS>
He sends ye not to murder me for this <EOS>
For in this sin he is as deep as I. <EOS>
If God will be revenged for this deed. <EOS>
O, know you yet, he doth it publicly, <EOS>
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm; <EOS>
He needs no indirect nor lawless course <EOS>
To cut off those that have offended him. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Who made thee, then, a bloody minister, <EOS>
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet, <EOS>
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee? <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault, <EOS>
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me; <EOS>
I am his brother, and I love him well. <EOS>
If you be hired for meed, go back again, <EOS>
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester, <EOS>
Who shall reward you better for my life <EOS>
Than Edward will for tidings of my death. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear: <EOS>
Go you to him from me. <EOS>
Both: <EOS>
Ay, so we will. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Tell him, when that our princely father York <EOS>
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm, <EOS>
And charged us from his soul to love each other, <EOS>
He little thought of this divided friendship: <EOS>
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
O, do not slander him, for he is kind. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Right, <EOS>
As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself: <EOS>
'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
It cannot be; for when I parted with him, <EOS>
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs, <EOS>
That he would labour my delivery. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee <EOS>
From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul, <EOS>
To counsel me to make my peace with God, <EOS>
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind, <EOS>
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me? <EOS>
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on <EOS>
To do this deed will hate you for the deed. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
What shall we do? <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Relent, and save your souls. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish. <EOS>
Which of you, if you were a prince's son, <EOS>
Being pent from liberty, as I am now, <EOS>
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you, <EOS>
Would not entreat for life? <EOS>
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks: <EOS>
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer, <EOS>
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me, <EOS>
As you would beg, were you in my distress <EOS>
A begging prince what beggar pities not? <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
Look behind you, my lord. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
Take that, and that: if all this will not do, <EOS>
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within. <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd! <EOS>
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands <EOS>
Of this most grievous guilty murder done! <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not? <EOS>
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art! <EOS>
Second Murderer: <EOS>
I would he knew that I had saved his brother! <EOS>
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say; <EOS>
For I repent me that the duke is slain. <EOS>
First Murderer: <EOS>
So do not I: go, coward as thou art. <EOS>
Now must I hide his body in some hole, <EOS>
Until the duke take order for his burial: <EOS>
And when I have my meed, I must away; <EOS>
For this will out, and here I must not stay. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Why, so: now have I done a good day's work: <EOS>
You peers, continue this united league: <EOS>
I every day expect an embassage <EOS>
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence; <EOS>
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven, <EOS>
Since I have set my friends at peace on earth. <EOS>
Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand; <EOS>
Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate: <EOS>
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like! <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Take heed you dally not before your king; <EOS>
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings <EOS>
Confound your hidden falsehood, and award <EOS>
Either of you to be the other's end. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
So prosper I, as I swear perfect love! <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
And I, as I love Hastings with my heart! <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Madam, yourself are not exempt in this, <EOS>
Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you; <EOS>
You have been factious one against the other, <EOS>
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand; <EOS>
And what you do, do it unfeignedly. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Here, Hastings; I will never more remember <EOS>
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine! <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess. <EOS>
DORSET: <EOS>
This interchange of love, I here protest, <EOS>
Upon my part shall be unviolable. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
And so swear I, my lord <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league <EOS>
With thy embracements to my wife's allies, <EOS>
And make me happy in your unity. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate <EOS>
On you or yours, <EOS>
but with all duteous love <EOS>
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me <EOS>
With hate in those where I expect most love! <EOS>
When I have most need to employ a friend, <EOS>
And most assured that he is a friend <EOS>
Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile, <EOS>
Be he unto me! this do I beg of God, <EOS>
When I am cold in zeal to yours. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham, <EOS>
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart. <EOS>
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here, <EOS>
To make the perfect period of this peace. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
And, in good time, here comes the noble duke. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen: <EOS>
And, princely peers, a happy time of day! <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day. <EOS>
Brother, we done deeds of charity; <EOS>
Made peace enmity, fair love of hate, <EOS>
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege: <EOS>
Amongst this princely heap, if any here, <EOS>
By false intelligence, or wrong surmise, <EOS>
Hold me a foe; <EOS>
If I unwittingly, or in my rage, <EOS>
Have aught committed that is hardly borne <EOS>
By any in this presence, I desire <EOS>
To reconcile me to his friendly peace: <EOS>
'Tis death to me to be at enmity; <EOS>
I hate it, and desire all good men's love. <EOS>
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you, <EOS>
Which I will purchase with my duteous service; <EOS>
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham, <EOS>
If ever any grudge were lodged between us; <EOS>
Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you; <EOS>
That without desert have frown'd on me; <EOS>
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all. <EOS>
I do not know that Englishman alive <EOS>
With whom my soul is any jot at odds <EOS>
More than the infant that is born to-night <EOS>
I thank my God for my humility. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter: <EOS>
I would to God all strifes were well compounded. <EOS>
My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty <EOS>
To take our brother Clarence to your grace. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this <EOS>
To be so bouted in this royal presence? <EOS>
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead? <EOS>
You do him injury to scorn his corse. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
All seeing heaven, what a world is this! <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest? <EOS>
DORSET: <EOS>
Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence <EOS>
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
But he, poor soul, by your first order died, <EOS>
And that a winged Mercury did bear: <EOS>
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand, <EOS>
That came too lag to see him buried. <EOS>
God grant that some, less noble and less loyal, <EOS>
Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood, <EOS>
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did, <EOS>
And yet go current from suspicion! <EOS>
DORSET: <EOS>
A boon, my sovereign, for my service done! <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow. <EOS>
DORSET: <EOS>
I will not rise, unless your highness grant. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st. <EOS>
DORSET: <EOS>
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life; <EOS>
Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman <EOS>
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Have a tongue to doom my brother's death, <EOS>
And shall the same give pardon to a slave? <EOS>
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought, <EOS>
And yet his punishment was cruel death. <EOS>
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage, <EOS>
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised <EOS>
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love? <EOS>
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake <EOS>
The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me? <EOS>
Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury <EOS>
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me, <EOS>
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'? <EOS>
Who told me, when we both lay in the field <EOS>
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me <EOS>
Even in his own garments, and gave himself, <EOS>
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night? <EOS>
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath <EOS>
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you <EOS>
Had so much grace to put it in my mind. <EOS>
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals <EOS>
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced <EOS>
The precious image of our dear Redeemer, <EOS>
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon; <EOS>
And I unjustly too, must grant it you <EOS>
But for my brother not a man would speak, <EOS>
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself <EOS>
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all <EOS>
Have been beholding to him in his life; <EOS>
Yet none of you would once plead for his life. <EOS>
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold <EOS>
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this! <EOS>
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. <EOS>
Oh, poor Clarence! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not <EOS>
How that the guilty kindred of the queen <EOS>
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death? <EOS>
O, they did urge it still unto the king! <EOS>
God will revenge it. But come, let us in, <EOS>
To comfort Edward with our company. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
We wait upon your grace. <EOS>
Boy: <EOS>
Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead? <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
No, boy. <EOS>
Boy: <EOS>
Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast, <EOS>
And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!' <EOS>
Girl: <EOS>
Why do you look on us, and shake your head, <EOS>
And call us wretches, orphans, castaways <EOS>
If that our noble father be alive? <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
My pretty cousins, you mistake me much; <EOS>
I do lament the sickness of the king. <EOS>
As loath to lose him, not your father's death; <EOS>
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost. <EOS>
Boy: <EOS>
Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead. <EOS>
The king my uncle is to blame for this: <EOS>
God will revenge it; whom I will importune <EOS>
With daily prayers all to that effect. <EOS>
Girl: <EOS>
And so will I. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well: <EOS>
Incapable and shallow innocents, <EOS>
You cannot guess who caused your father's death. <EOS>
Boy: <EOS>
Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester <EOS>
Told me, the king, provoked by the queen, <EOS>
Devised impeachments to imprison him : <EOS>
And when my uncle told me so, he wept, <EOS>
And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek; <EOS>
Bade me rely on him as on my father, <EOS>
And he would love me dearly as his child. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes, <EOS>
And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile! <EOS>
He is my son; yea, and therein my shame; <EOS>
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit. <EOS>
Boy: <EOS>
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam? <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Ay, boy. <EOS>
Boy: <EOS>
I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep, <EOS>
To chide my fortune, and torment myself? <EOS>
I'll join with black despair against my soul, <EOS>
And to myself become an enemy. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
What means this scene of rude impatience? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
To make an act of tragic violence: <EOS>
Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead. <EOS>
Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd? <EOS>
Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone? <EOS>
If you will live, lament; if die, be brief, <EOS>
That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's; <EOS>
Or, like obedient subjects, follow him <EOS>
To his new kingdom of perpetual rest. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow <EOS>
As I had title in thy noble husband! <EOS>
I have bewept a worthy husband's death, <EOS>
And lived by looking on his images: <EOS>
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance <EOS>
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death, <EOS>
And I for comfort have but one false glass, <EOS>
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him. <EOS>
Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother, <EOS>
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee: <EOS>
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms, <EOS>
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs, <EOS>
Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I, <EOS>
Thine being but a moiety of my grief, <EOS>
To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries! <EOS>
Boy: <EOS>
Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death; <EOS>
How can we aid you with our kindred tears? <EOS>
Girl: <EOS>
Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd; <EOS>
Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept! <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Give me no help in lamentation; <EOS>
I am not barren to bring forth complaints <EOS>
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes, <EOS>
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon, <EOS>
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world! <EOS>
Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward! <EOS>
Children: <EOS>
Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence! <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence! <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone. <EOS>
Children: <EOS>
What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
What stays had I but they? and they are gone. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Was never widow had so dear a loss! <EOS>
Children: <EOS>
Were never orphans had so dear a loss! <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Was never mother had so dear a loss! <EOS>
Alas, I am the mother of these moans! <EOS>
Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general. <EOS>
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I; <EOS>
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she: <EOS>
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I; <EOS>
I for an Edward weep, so do not they: <EOS>
Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd, <EOS>
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse, <EOS>
And I will pamper it with lamentations. <EOS>
DORSET: <EOS>
Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased <EOS>
That you take with unthankfulness, his doing: <EOS>
In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful, <EOS>
With dull unwilligness to repay a debt <EOS>
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent; <EOS>
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven, <EOS>
For it requires the royal debt it lent you. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother, <EOS>
Of the young prince your son: send straight for him <EOS>
Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives: <EOS>
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave, <EOS>
And plant your joys in living Edward's throne. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause <EOS>
To wail the dimming of our shining star; <EOS>
But none can cure their harms by wailing them. <EOS>
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy; <EOS>
I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee <EOS>
I crave your blessing. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind, <EOS>
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers, <EOS>
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan, <EOS>
Now cheer each other in each other's love <EOS>
Though we have spent our harvest of this king, <EOS>
We are to reap the harvest of his son. <EOS>
The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts, <EOS>
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together, <EOS>
Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept: <EOS>
Me seemeth good, that, with some little train, <EOS>
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd <EOS>
Hither to London, to be crown'd our king. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude, <EOS>
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out, <EOS>
Which would be so much the more dangerous <EOS>
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd: <EOS>
Where every horse bears his commanding rein, <EOS>
And may direct his course as please himself, <EOS>
As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent, <EOS>
In my opinion, ought to be prevented. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I hope the king made peace with all of us <EOS>
And the compact is firm and true in me. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
And so in me; and so, I think, in all: <EOS>
Yet, since it is but green, it should be put <EOS>
To no apparent likelihood of breach, <EOS>
Which haply by much company might be urged: <EOS>
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham, <EOS>
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
And so say I. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Then be it so; and go we to determine <EOS>
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow. <EOS>
Madam, and you, my mother, will you go <EOS>
To give your censures in this weighty business? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
With all our harts. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince, <EOS>
For God's sake, let not us two be behind; <EOS>
For, by the way, I'll sort occasion, <EOS>
As index to the story we late talk'd of, <EOS>
To part the queen's proud kindred from the king. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
My other self, my counsel's consistory, <EOS>
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin, <EOS>
I, like a child, will go by thy direction. <EOS>
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast? <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
I promise you, I scarcely know myself: <EOS>
Hear you the news abroad? <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Ay, that the king is dead. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better: <EOS>
I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
Neighbours, God speed! <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Give you good morrow, sir. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death? <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while! <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
Then, masters, look to see a troublous world. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child! <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
In him there is a hope of government, <EOS>
That in his nonage council under him, <EOS>
And in his full and ripen'd years himself, <EOS>
No doubt, shall then and till then govern well. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth <EOS>
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot; <EOS>
For then this land was famously enrich'd <EOS>
With politic grave counsel; then the king <EOS>
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
Better it were they all came by the father, <EOS>
Or by the father there were none at all; <EOS>
For emulation now, who shall be nearest, <EOS>
Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not. <EOS>
O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester! <EOS>
And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud: <EOS>
And were they to be ruled, and not to rule, <EOS>
This sickly land might solace as before. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks; <EOS>
When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand; <EOS>
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night? <EOS>
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth. <EOS>
All may be well; but, if God sort it so, <EOS>
'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect. <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
Truly, the souls of men are full of dread: <EOS>
Ye cannot reason almost with a man <EOS>
That looks not heavily and full of fear. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
Before the times of change, still is it so: <EOS>
By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust <EOS>
Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see <EOS>
The waters swell before a boisterous storm. <EOS>
But leave it all to God. whither away? <EOS>
Second Citizen: <EOS>
Marry, we were sent for to the justices. <EOS>
Third Citizen: <EOS>
And so was I: I'll bear you company. <EOS>
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: <EOS>
Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton; <EOS>
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night: <EOS>
To-morrow, or next day, they will be here. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
I long with all my heart to see the prince: <EOS>
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
But I hear, no; they say my son of York <EOS>
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Ay, mother; but I would not have it so. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper, <EOS>
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow <EOS>
More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle <EOS>
Gloucester, <EOS>
'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:' <EOS>
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast, <EOS>
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold <EOS>
In him that did object the same to thee; <EOS>
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young, <EOS>
So long a-growing and so leisurely, <EOS>
That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious. <EOS>
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: <EOS>
Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd, <EOS>
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout, <EOS>
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast <EOS>
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old <EOS>
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth. <EOS>
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this? <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Grandam, his nurse. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd. <EOS>
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: <EOS>
Good madam, be not angry with the child. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Pitchers have ears. <EOS>
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: <EOS>
Here comes a messenger. What news? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
How fares the prince? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Well, madam, and in health. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
What is thy news then? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret, <EOS>
With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Who hath committed them? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
The mighty dukes <EOS>
Gloucester and Buckingham. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
For what offence? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed; <EOS>
Why or for what these nobles were committed <EOS>
Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Ay me, I see the downfall of our house! <EOS>
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind; <EOS>
Insulting tyranny begins to jet <EOS>
Upon the innocent and aweless throne: <EOS>
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre! <EOS>
I see, as in a map, the end of all. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days, <EOS>
How many of you have mine eyes beheld! <EOS>
My husband lost his life to get the crown; <EOS>
And often up and down my sons were toss'd, <EOS>
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss: <EOS>
And being seated, and domestic broils <EOS>
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors. <EOS>
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood, <EOS>
Self against self: O, preposterous <EOS>
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen; <EOS>
Or let me die, to look on death no more! <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary. <EOS>
Madam, farewell. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
I'll go along with you. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
You have no cause. <EOS>
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: <EOS>
My gracious lady, go; <EOS>
And thither bear your treasure and your goods. <EOS>
For my part, I'll resign unto your grace <EOS>
The seal I keep: and so betide to me <EOS>
As well I tender you and all of yours! <EOS>
Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign <EOS>
The weary way hath made you melancholy. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
No, uncle; but our crosses on the way <EOS>
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy <EOS>
I want more uncles here to welcome me. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years <EOS>
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit <EOS>
Nor more can you distinguish of a man <EOS>
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows, <EOS>
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart. <EOS>
Those uncles which you want were dangerous; <EOS>
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words, <EOS>
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts : <EOS>
God keep you from them, and from such false friends! <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
God keep me from false friends! but they were none. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you. <EOS>
Lord Mayor: <EOS>
God bless your grace with health and happy days! <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all. <EOS>
I thought my mother, and my brother York, <EOS>
Would long ere this have met us on the way <EOS>
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not <EOS>
To tell us whether they will come or no! <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come? <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
On what occasion, God he knows, not I, <EOS>
The queen your mother, and your brother York, <EOS>
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince <EOS>
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace, <EOS>
But by his mother was perforce withheld. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course <EOS>
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace <EOS>
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York <EOS>
Unto his princely brother presently? <EOS>
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him, <EOS>
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce. <EOS>
CARDINAL: <EOS>
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory <EOS>
Can from his mother win the Duke of York, <EOS>
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate <EOS>
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid <EOS>
We should infringe the holy privilege <EOS>
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land <EOS>
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord, <EOS>
Too ceremonious and traditional <EOS>
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age, <EOS>
You break not sanctuary in seizing him. <EOS>
The benefit thereof is always granted <EOS>
To those whose dealings have deserved the place, <EOS>
And those who have the wit to claim the place: <EOS>
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it; <EOS>
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it: <EOS>
Then, taking him from thence that is not there, <EOS>
You break no privilege nor charter there. <EOS>
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men; <EOS>
But sanctuary children ne'er till now. <EOS>
CARDINAL: <EOS>
My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once. <EOS>
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me? <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
I go, my lord. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may. <EOS>
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come, <EOS>
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Where it seems best unto your royal self. <EOS>
If I may counsel you, some day or two <EOS>
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower: <EOS>
Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit <EOS>
For your best health and recreation. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
I do not like the Tower, of any place. <EOS>
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place; <EOS>
Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
Is it upon record, or else reported <EOS>
Successively from age to age, he built it? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Upon record, my gracious lord. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
But say, my lord, it were not register'd, <EOS>
Methinks the truth should live from age to age, <EOS>
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity, <EOS>
Even to the general all-ending day. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
What say you, uncle? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I say, without characters, fame lives long. <EOS>
Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity, <EOS>
I moralize two meanings in one word. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
That Julius Caesar was a famous man; <EOS>
With what his valour did enrich his wit, <EOS>
His wit set down to make his valour live <EOS>
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror; <EOS>
For now he lives in fame, though not in life. <EOS>
I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,-- <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
What, my gracious lord? <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
An if I live until I be a man, <EOS>
I'll win our ancient right in France again, <EOS>
Or die a soldier, as I lived a king. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
Richard of York! how fares our loving brother? <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours: <EOS>
Too late he died that might have kept that title, <EOS>
Which by his death hath lost much majesty. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York? <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord, <EOS>
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth <EOS>
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
He hath, my lord. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
And therefore is he idle? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Then is he more beholding to you than I. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
He may command me as my sovereign; <EOS>
But you have power in me as in a kinsman. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
A beggar, brother? <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give; <EOS>
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
A gentle cousin, were it light enough. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts; <EOS>
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
It is too heavy for your grace to wear. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
What, would you have my weapon, little lord? <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
I would, that I might thank you as you call me. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
How? <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Little. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk: <EOS>
Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me: <EOS>
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me; <EOS>
Because that I am little, like an ape, <EOS>
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons! <EOS>
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle, <EOS>
He prettily and aptly taunts himself: <EOS>
So cunning and so young is wonderful. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
My lord, will't please you pass along? <EOS>
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham <EOS>
Will to your mother, to entreat of her <EOS>
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord? <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
My lord protector needs will have it so. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Why, what should you fear? <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost: <EOS>
My grandam told me he was murdered there. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
I fear no uncles dead. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Nor none that live, I hope. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
An if they live, I hope I need not fear. <EOS>
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart, <EOS>
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Think you, my lord, this little prating York <EOS>
Was not incensed by his subtle mother <EOS>
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy; <EOS>
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable <EOS>
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby. <EOS>
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend <EOS>
As closely to conceal what we impart: <EOS>
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way; <EOS>
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter <EOS>
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind, <EOS>
For the instalment of this noble duke <EOS>
In the seat royal of this famous isle? <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
He for his father's sake so loves the prince, <EOS>
That he will not be won to aught against him. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he? <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
He will do all in all as Hastings doth. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby, <EOS>
And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings, <EOS>
How doth he stand affected to our purpose; <EOS>
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower, <EOS>
To sit about the coronation. <EOS>
If thou dost find him tractable to us, <EOS>
Encourage him, and show him all our reasons: <EOS>
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling, <EOS>
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk, <EOS>
And give us notice of his inclination: <EOS>
For we to-morrow hold divided councils, <EOS>
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby, <EOS>
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries <EOS>
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle; <EOS>
And bid my friend, for joy of this good news, <EOS>
Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly. <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
My good lords both, with all the heed I may. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep? <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
You shall, my lord. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive <EOS>
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do: <EOS>
And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me <EOS>
The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables <EOS>
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
And look to have it yielded with all willingness. <EOS>
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards <EOS>
We may digest our complots in some form. <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
What, ho! my lord! <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
A messenger from the Lord Stanley. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
What is't o'clock? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Upon the stroke of four. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
So it should seem by that I have to say. <EOS>
First, he commends him to your noble lordship. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
And then? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
And then he sends you word <EOS>
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm: <EOS>
Besides, he says there are two councils held; <EOS>
And that may be determined at the one <EOS>
which may make you and him to rue at the other. <EOS>
Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure, <EOS>
If presently you will take horse with him, <EOS>
And with all speed post with him toward the north, <EOS>
To shun the danger that his soul divines. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord; <EOS>
Bid him not fear the separated councils <EOS>
His honour and myself are at the one, <EOS>
And at the other is my servant Catesby <EOS>
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us <EOS>
Whereof I shall not have intelligence. <EOS>
Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance: <EOS>
And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond <EOS>
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers <EOS>
To fly the boar before the boar pursues, <EOS>
Were to incense the boar to follow us <EOS>
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase. <EOS>
Go, bid thy master rise and come to me <EOS>
And we will both together to the Tower, <EOS>
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly. <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say. <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
Many good morrows to my noble lord! <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring <EOS>
What news, what news, in this our tottering state? <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord; <EOS>
And I believe twill never stand upright <EOS>
Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown? <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
Ay, my good lord. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders <EOS>
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced. <EOS>
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it? <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward <EOS>
Upon his party for the gain thereof: <EOS>
And thereupon he sends you this good news, <EOS>
That this same very day your enemies, <EOS>
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news, <EOS>
Because they have been still mine enemies: <EOS>
But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side, <EOS>
To bar my master's heirs in true descent, <EOS>
God knows I will not do it, to the death. <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
God keep your lordship in that gracious mind! <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence, <EOS>
That they who brought me in my master's hate <EOS>
I live to look upon their tragedy. <EOS>
I tell thee, Catesby-- <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
What, my lord? <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Ere a fortnight make me elder, <EOS>
I'll send some packing that yet think not on it. <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord, <EOS>
When men are unprepared and look not for it. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out <EOS>
With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do <EOS>
With some men else, who think themselves as safe <EOS>
As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear <EOS>
To princely Richard and to Buckingham. <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
The princes both make high account of you; <EOS>
For they account his head upon the bridge. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
I know they do; and I have well deserved it. <EOS>
Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man? <EOS>
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided? <EOS>
STANLEY: <EOS>
My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby: <EOS>
You may jest on, but, by the holy rood, <EOS>
I do not like these several councils, I. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
My lord, <EOS>
I hold my life as dear as you do yours; <EOS>
And never in my life, I do protest, <EOS>
Was it more precious to me than 'tis now: <EOS>
Think you, but that I know our state secure, <EOS>
I would be so triumphant as I am? <EOS>
STANLEY: <EOS>
The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London, <EOS>
Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure, <EOS>
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust; <EOS>
But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast. <EOS>
This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt: <EOS>
Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward! <EOS>
What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord? <EOS>
To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded. <EOS>
LORD STANLEY: <EOS>
They, for their truth, might better wear their heads <EOS>
Than some that have accused them wear their hats. <EOS>
But come, my lord, let us away. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow. <EOS>
How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee? <EOS>
Pursuivant: <EOS>
The better that your lordship please to ask. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now <EOS>
Than when I met thee last where now we meet: <EOS>
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower, <EOS>
By the suggestion of the queen's allies; <EOS>
But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself-- <EOS>
This day those enemies are put to death, <EOS>
And I in better state than e'er I was. <EOS>
Pursuivant: <EOS>
God hold it, to your honour's good content! <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me. <EOS>
Pursuivant: <EOS>
God save your lordship! <EOS>
Priest: <EOS>
Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart. <EOS>
I am in your debt for your last exercise; <EOS>
Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain? <EOS>
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest; <EOS>
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Good faith, and when I met this holy man, <EOS>
Those men you talk of came into my mind. <EOS>
What, go you toward the Tower? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay <EOS>
I shall return before your lordship thence. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
I'll wait upon your lordship. <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
Come, bring forth the prisoners. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this: <EOS>
To-day shalt thou behold a subject die <EOS>
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty. <EOS>
GREY: <EOS>
God keep the prince from all the pack of you! <EOS>
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers! <EOS>
VAUGHAN: <EOS>
You live that shall cry woe for this after. <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison, <EOS>
Fatal and ominous to noble peers! <EOS>
Within the guilty closure of thy walls <EOS>
Richard the second here was hack'd to death; <EOS>
And, for more slander to thy dismal seat, <EOS>
We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink. <EOS>
GREY: <EOS>
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads, <EOS>
For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham, <EOS>
Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God <EOS>
To hear her prayers for them, as now for us <EOS>
And for my sister and her princely sons, <EOS>
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood, <EOS>
Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt. <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
Make haste; the hour of death is expiate. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace: <EOS>
And take our leave, until we meet in heaven. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
My lords, at once: the cause why we are met <EOS>
Is, to determine of the coronation. <EOS>
In God's name, speak: when is the royal day? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Are all things fitting for that royal time? <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
It is, and wants but nomination. <EOS>
BISHOP OF ELY: <EOS>
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Who knows the lord protector's mind herein? <EOS>
Who is most inward with the royal duke? <EOS>
BISHOP OF ELY: <EOS>
Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces, <EOS>
But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine, <EOS>
Than I of yours; <EOS>
Nor I no more of his, than you of mine. <EOS>
Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
I thank his grace, I know he loves me well; <EOS>
But, for his purpose in the coronation. <EOS>
I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd <EOS>
His gracious pleasure any way therein: <EOS>
But you, my noble lords, may name the time; <EOS>
And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice, <EOS>
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part. <EOS>
BISHOP OF ELY: <EOS>
Now in good time, here comes the duke himself. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow. <EOS>
I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope, <EOS>
My absence doth neglect no great designs, <EOS>
Which by my presence might have been concluded. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Had not you come upon your cue, my lord <EOS>
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,-- <EOS>
I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder; <EOS>
His lordship knows me well, and loves me well. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
I thank your grace. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
My lord of Ely! <EOS>
BISHOP OF ELY: <EOS>
My lord? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
When I was last in Holborn, <EOS>
I saw good strawberries in your garden there <EOS>
I do beseech you send for some of them. <EOS>
BISHOP OF ELY: <EOS>
Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you. <EOS>
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business, <EOS>
And finds the testy gentleman so hot, <EOS>
As he will lose his head ere give consent <EOS>
His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it, <EOS>
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you. <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
We have not yet set down this day of triumph. <EOS>
To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden; <EOS>
For I myself am not so well provided <EOS>
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd. <EOS>
BISHOP OF ELY: <EOS>
Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these <EOS>
strawberries. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day; <EOS>
There's some conceit or other likes him well, <EOS>
When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit. <EOS>
I think there's never a man in Christendom <EOS>
That can less hide his love or hate than he; <EOS>
For by his face straight shall you know his heart. <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
What of his heart perceive you in his face <EOS>
By any likelihood he show'd to-day? <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Marry, that with no man here he is offended; <EOS>
For, were he, he had shown it in his looks. <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
I pray God he be not, I say. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I pray you all, tell me what they deserve <EOS>
That do conspire my death with devilish plots <EOS>
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd <EOS>
Upon my body with their hellish charms? <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
The tender love I bear your grace, my lord, <EOS>
Makes me most forward in this noble presence <EOS>
To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be <EOS>
I say, my lord, they have deserved death. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Then be your eyes the witness of this ill: <EOS>
See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm <EOS>
Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up: <EOS>
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch, <EOS>
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore, <EOS>
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
If they have done this thing, my gracious lord-- <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
If I thou protector of this damned strumpet-- <EOS>
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor: <EOS>
Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear, <EOS>
I will not dine until I see the same. <EOS>
Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done: <EOS>
The rest, that love me, rise and follow me. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me; <EOS>
For I, too fond, might have prevented this. <EOS>
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm; <EOS>
But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly: <EOS>
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble, <EOS>
And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower, <EOS>
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house. <EOS>
O, now I want the priest that spake to me: <EOS>
I now repent I told the pursuivant <EOS>
As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies, <EOS>
How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd, <EOS>
And I myself secure in grace and favour. <EOS>
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse <EOS>
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head! <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner: <EOS>
Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
O momentary grace of mortal men, <EOS>
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God! <EOS>
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks, <EOS>
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast, <EOS>
Ready, with every nod, to tumble down <EOS>
Into the fatal bowels of the deep. <EOS>
LOVEL: <EOS>
Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
O bloody Richard! miserable England! <EOS>
I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee <EOS>
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon. <EOS>
Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head. <EOS>
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour, <EOS>
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word, <EOS>
And then begin again, and stop again, <EOS>
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian; <EOS>
Speak and look back, and pry on every side, <EOS>
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw, <EOS>
Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks <EOS>
Are at my service, like enforced smiles; <EOS>
And both are ready in their offices, <EOS>
At any time, to grace my stratagems. <EOS>
But what, is Catesby gone? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Lord mayor,-- <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Look to the drawbridge there! <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Hark! a drum. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Catesby, o'erlook the walls. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Lord mayor, the reason we have sent-- <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Look back, defend thee, here are enemies. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
God and our innocency defend and guard us! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel. <EOS>
LOVEL: <EOS>
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor, <EOS>
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
So dear I loved the man, that I must weep. <EOS>
I took him for the plainest harmless creature <EOS>
That breathed upon this earth a Christian; <EOS>
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded <EOS>
The history of all her secret thoughts: <EOS>
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue, <EOS>
That, his apparent open guilt omitted, <EOS>
I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife, <EOS>
He lived from all attainder of suspect. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor <EOS>
That ever lived. <EOS>
Would you imagine, or almost believe, <EOS>
Were't not that, by great preservation, <EOS>
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor <EOS>
This day had plotted, in the council-house <EOS>
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester? <EOS>
Lord Mayor: <EOS>
What, had he so? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
What, think You we are Turks or infidels? <EOS>
Or that we would, against the form of law, <EOS>
Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death, <EOS>
But that the extreme peril of the case, <EOS>
The peace of England and our persons' safety, <EOS>
Enforced us to this execution? <EOS>
Lord Mayor: <EOS>
Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death; <EOS>
And you my good lords, both have well proceeded, <EOS>
To warn false traitors from the like attempts. <EOS>
I never look'd for better at his hands, <EOS>
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Yet had not we determined he should die, <EOS>
Until your lordship came to see his death; <EOS>
Which now the loving haste of these our friends, <EOS>
Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented: <EOS>
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard <EOS>
The traitor speak, and timorously confess <EOS>
The manner and the purpose of his treason; <EOS>
That you might well have signified the same <EOS>
Unto the citizens, who haply may <EOS>
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death. <EOS>
Lord Mayor: <EOS>
But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve, <EOS>
As well as I had seen and heard him speak <EOS>
And doubt you not, right noble princes both, <EOS>
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens <EOS>
With all your just proceedings in this cause. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here, <EOS>
To avoid the carping censures of the world. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
But since you come too late of our intents, <EOS>
Yet witness what you hear we did intend: <EOS>
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham. <EOS>
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post: <EOS>
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time, <EOS>
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children: <EOS>
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen, <EOS>
Only for saying he would make his son <EOS>
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house, <EOS>
Which, by the sign thereof was termed so. <EOS>
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury <EOS>
And bestial appetite in change of lust; <EOS>
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives, <EOS>
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart, <EOS>
Without control, listed to make his prey. <EOS>
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person: <EOS>
Tell them, when that my mother went with child <EOS>
Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York <EOS>
My princely father then had wars in France <EOS>
And, by just computation of the time, <EOS>
Found that the issue was not his begot; <EOS>
Which well appeared in his lineaments, <EOS>
Being nothing like the noble duke my father: <EOS>
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off, <EOS>
Because you know, my lord, my mother lives. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator <EOS>
As if the golden fee for which I plead <EOS>
Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle; <EOS>
Where you shall find me well accompanied <EOS>
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
I go: and towards three or four o'clock <EOS>
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw; <EOS>
Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both <EOS>
Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle. <EOS>
Now will I in, to take some privy order, <EOS>
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight; <EOS>
And to give notice, that no manner of person <EOS>
At any time have recourse unto the princes. <EOS>
Scrivener: <EOS>
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings; <EOS>
Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd, <EOS>
That it may be this day read over in Paul's. <EOS>
And mark how well the sequel hangs together: <EOS>
Eleven hours I spent to write it over, <EOS>
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me; <EOS>
The precedent was full as long a-doing: <EOS>
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings, <EOS>
Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty <EOS>
Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross, <EOS>
That seeth not this palpable device? <EOS>
Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not? <EOS>
Bad is the world; and all will come to nought, <EOS>
When such bad dealings must be seen in thought. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
How now, my lord, what say the citizens? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord, <EOS>
The citizens are mum and speak not a word. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy, <EOS>
And his contract by deputy in France; <EOS>
The insatiate greediness of his desires, <EOS>
And his enforcement of the city wives; <EOS>
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy, <EOS>
As being got, your father then in France, <EOS>
His resemblance, being not like the duke; <EOS>
Withal I did infer your lineaments, <EOS>
Being the right idea of your father, <EOS>
Both in your form and nobleness of mind; <EOS>
Laid open all your victories in Scotland, <EOS>
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace, <EOS>
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility: <EOS>
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose <EOS>
Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse <EOS>
And when mine oratory grew to an end <EOS>
I bid them that did love their country's good <EOS>
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!' <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Ah! and did they so? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
No, so God help me, they spake not a word; <EOS>
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones, <EOS>
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale. <EOS>
Which when I saw, I reprehended them; <EOS>
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence: <EOS>
His answer was, the people were not wont <EOS>
To be spoke to but by the recorder. <EOS>
Then he was urged to tell my tale again, <EOS>
'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;' <EOS>
But nothing spake in warrant from himself. <EOS>
When he had done, some followers of mine own, <EOS>
At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps, <EOS>
And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!' <EOS>
And thus I took the vantage of those few, <EOS>
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I; <EOS>
'This general applause and loving shout <EOS>
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:' <EOS>
And even here brake off, and came away. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
No, by my troth, my lord. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear; <EOS>
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit: <EOS>
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand, <EOS>
And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord; <EOS>
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant: <EOS>
And be not easily won to our request: <EOS>
Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I go; and if you plead as well for them <EOS>
As I can say nay to thee for myself, <EOS>
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks. <EOS>
Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here; <EOS>
I think the duke will not be spoke withal. <EOS>
Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby, <EOS>
What says he? <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
My lord: he doth entreat your grace; <EOS>
To visit him to-morrow or next day: <EOS>
He is within, with two right reverend fathers, <EOS>
Divinely bent to meditation; <EOS>
And no worldly suit would he be moved, <EOS>
To draw him from his holy exercise. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again; <EOS>
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens, <EOS>
In deep designs and matters of great moment, <EOS>
No less importing than our general good, <EOS>
Are come to have some conference with his grace. <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
I'll tell him what you say, my lord. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward! <EOS>
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed, <EOS>
But on his knees at meditation; <EOS>
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans, <EOS>
But meditating with two deep divines; <EOS>
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body, <EOS>
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul: <EOS>
Happy were England, would this gracious prince <EOS>
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof: <EOS>
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it. <EOS>
Lord Mayor: <EOS>
Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay! <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
I fear he will. <EOS>
How now, Catesby, what says your lord? <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
My lord, <EOS>
He wonders to what end you have assembled <EOS>
Such troops of citizens to speak with him, <EOS>
His grace not being warn'd thereof before: <EOS>
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Sorry I am my noble cousin should <EOS>
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him: <EOS>
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him; <EOS>
And so once more return and tell his grace. <EOS>
When holy and devout religious men <EOS>
Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence, <EOS>
So sweet is zealous contemplation. <EOS>
Lord Mayor: <EOS>
See, where he stands between two clergymen! <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince, <EOS>
To stay him from the fall of vanity: <EOS>
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand, <EOS>
True ornaments to know a holy man. <EOS>
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince, <EOS>
Lend favourable ears to our request; <EOS>
And pardon us the interruption <EOS>
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
My lord, there needs no such apology: <EOS>
I rather do beseech you pardon me, <EOS>
Who, earnest in the service of my God, <EOS>
Neglect the visitation of my friends. <EOS>
But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above, <EOS>
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I do suspect I have done some offence <EOS>
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes, <EOS>
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
You have, my lord: would it might please your grace, <EOS>
At our entreaties, to amend that fault! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Then know, it is your fault that you resign <EOS>
The supreme seat, the throne majestical, <EOS>
The scepter'd office of your ancestors, <EOS>
Your state of fortune and your due of birth, <EOS>
The lineal glory of your royal house, <EOS>
To the corruption of a blemished stock: <EOS>
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts, <EOS>
Which here we waken to our country's good, <EOS>
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs; <EOS>
Her face defaced with scars of infamy, <EOS>
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants, <EOS>
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf <EOS>
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion. <EOS>
Which to recure, we heartily solicit <EOS>
Your gracious self to take on you the charge <EOS>
And kingly government of this your land, <EOS>
Not as protector, steward, substitute, <EOS>
Or lowly factor for another's gain; <EOS>
But as successively from blood to blood, <EOS>
Your right of birth, your empery, your own. <EOS>
For this, consorted with the citizens, <EOS>
Your very worshipful and loving friends, <EOS>
And by their vehement instigation, <EOS>
In this just suit come I to move your grace. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I know not whether to depart in silence, <EOS>
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof. <EOS>
Best fitteth my degree or your condition <EOS>
If not to answer, you might haply think <EOS>
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded <EOS>
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty, <EOS>
Which fondly you would here impose on me; <EOS>
If to reprove you for this suit of yours, <EOS>
So season'd with your faithful love to me. <EOS>
Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends. <EOS>
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first, <EOS>
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last, <EOS>
Definitively thus I answer you. <EOS>
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert <EOS>
Unmeritable shuns your high request. <EOS>
First if all obstacles were cut away, <EOS>
And that my path were even to the crown, <EOS>
As my ripe revenue and due by birth <EOS>
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit, <EOS>
So mighty and so many my defects, <EOS>
As I had rather hide me from my greatness, <EOS>
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea, <EOS>
Than in my greatness covet to be hid, <EOS>
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd. <EOS>
But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me, <EOS>
And much I need to help you, if need were; <EOS>
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit, <EOS>
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time, <EOS>
Will well become the seat of majesty, <EOS>
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign. <EOS>
On him I lay what you would lay on me, <EOS>
The right and fortune of his happy stars; <EOS>
Which God defend that I should wring from him! <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
My lord, this argues conscience in your grace; <EOS>
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial, <EOS>
All circumstances well considered. <EOS>
You say that Edward is your brother's son: <EOS>
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife; <EOS>
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy-- <EOS>
Your mother lives a witness to that vow-- <EOS>
And afterward by substitute betroth'd <EOS>
To Bona, sister to the King of France. <EOS>
These both put by a poor petitioner, <EOS>
A care-crazed mother of a many children, <EOS>
A beauty-waning and distressed widow, <EOS>
Even in the afternoon of her best days, <EOS>
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye, <EOS>
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts <EOS>
To base declension and loathed bigamy <EOS>
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got <EOS>
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince. <EOS>
More bitterly could I expostulate, <EOS>
Save that, for reverence to some alive, <EOS>
I give a sparing limit to my tongue. <EOS>
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self <EOS>
This proffer'd benefit of dignity; <EOS>
If non to bless us and the land withal, <EOS>
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry <EOS>
From the corruption of abusing times, <EOS>
Unto a lineal true-derived course. <EOS>
Lord Mayor: <EOS>
Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love. <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Alas, why would you heap these cares on me? <EOS>
I am unfit for state and majesty; <EOS>
I do beseech you, take it not amiss; <EOS>
I cannot nor I will not yield to you. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal, <EOS>
Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son; <EOS>
As well we know your tenderness of heart <EOS>
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse, <EOS>
Which we have noted in you to your kin, <EOS>
And egally indeed to all estates,-- <EOS>
Yet whether you accept our suit or no, <EOS>
Your brother's son shall never reign our king; <EOS>
But we will plant some other in the throne, <EOS>
To the disgrace and downfall of your house: <EOS>
And in this resolution here we leave you.-- <EOS>
Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham. <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit. <EOS>
ANOTHER: <EOS>
Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Would you enforce me to a world of care? <EOS>
Well, call them again. I am not made of stone, <EOS>
But penetrable to your. kind entreats, <EOS>
Albeit against my conscience and my soul. <EOS>
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men, <EOS>
Since you will buckle fortune on my back, <EOS>
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no, <EOS>
I must have patience to endure the load: <EOS>
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach <EOS>
Attend the sequel of your imposition, <EOS>
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me <EOS>
From all the impure blots and stains thereof; <EOS>
For God he knows, and you may partly see, <EOS>
How far I am from the desire thereof. <EOS>
Lord Mayor: <EOS>
God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
In saying so, you shall but say the truth. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Then I salute you with this kingly title: <EOS>
Long live Richard, England's royal king! <EOS>
Lord Mayor: <EOS>
Amen. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Even when you please, since you will have it so. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace: <EOS>
And so most joyfully we take our leave. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Come, let us to our holy task again. <EOS>
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet <EOS>
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester? <EOS>
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower, <EOS>
On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes. <EOS>
Daughter, well met. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
God give your graces both <EOS>
A happy and a joyful time of day! <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
As much to you, good sister! Whither away? <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess, <EOS>
Upon the like devotion as yourselves, <EOS>
To gratulate the gentle princes there. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together. <EOS>
And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes. <EOS>
Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave, <EOS>
How doth the prince, and my young son of York? <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
Right well, dear madam. By your patience, <EOS>
I may not suffer you to visit them; <EOS>
The king hath straitly charged the contrary. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
The king! why, who's that? <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
The Lord protect him from that kingly title! <EOS>
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me? <EOS>
I am their mother; who should keep me from them? <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
I am their fathers mother; I will see them. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother: <EOS>
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame <EOS>
And take thy office from thee, on my peril. <EOS>
BRAKENBURY: <EOS>
No, madam, no; I may not leave it so: <EOS>
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me. <EOS>
LORD STANLEY: <EOS>
Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence, <EOS>
And I'll salute your grace of York as mother, <EOS>
And reverend looker on, of two fair queens. <EOS>
Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster, <EOS>
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart <EOS>
May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon <EOS>
With this dead-killing news! <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news! <EOS>
DORSET: <EOS>
Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence! <EOS>
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels; <EOS>
Thy mother's name is ominous to children. <EOS>
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas, <EOS>
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell <EOS>
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house, <EOS>
Lest thou increase the number of the dead; <EOS>
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse, <EOS>
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen. <EOS>
LORD STANLEY: <EOS>
Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam. <EOS>
Take all the swift advantage of the hours; <EOS>
You shall have letters from me to my son <EOS>
To meet you on the way, and welcome you. <EOS>
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
O ill-dispersing wind of misery! <EOS>
O my accursed womb, the bed of death! <EOS>
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world, <EOS>
Whose unavoided eye is murderous. <EOS>
LORD STANLEY: <EOS>
Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
And I in all unwillingness will go. <EOS>
I would to God that the inclusive verge <EOS>
Of golden metal that must round my brow <EOS>
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain! <EOS>
Anointed let me be with deadly venom, <EOS>
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen! <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory <EOS>
To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
No! why?  When he that is my husband now <EOS>
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse, <EOS>
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands <EOS>
Which issued from my other angel husband <EOS>
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd; <EOS>
O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face, <EOS>
This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed, <EOS>
For making me, so young, so old a widow! <EOS>
And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed; <EOS>
And be thy wife--if any be so mad-- <EOS>
As miserable by the life of thee <EOS>
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death! <EOS>
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again, <EOS>
Even in so short a space, my woman's heart <EOS>
Grossly grew captive to his honey words <EOS>
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse, <EOS>
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest; <EOS>
For never yet one hour in his bed <EOS>
Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep, <EOS>
But have been waked by his timorous dreams. <EOS>
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick; <EOS>
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining. <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory! <EOS>
LADY ANNE: <EOS>
Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it! <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower. <EOS>
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes <EOS>
Whom envy hath immured within your walls! <EOS>
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones! <EOS>
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow <EOS>
For tender princes, use my babies well! <EOS>
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham! <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
My gracious sovereign? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Give me thy hand. <EOS>
Thus high, by thy advice <EOS>
And thy assistance, is King Richard seated; <EOS>
But shall we wear these honours for a day? <EOS>
Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Still live they and for ever may they last! <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
O Buckingham, now do I play the touch, <EOS>
To try if thou be current gold indeed <EOS>
Young Edward lives: think now what I would say. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Say on, my loving lord. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king, <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
True, noble prince. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
O bitter consequence, <EOS>
That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!' <EOS>
Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull: <EOS>
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead; <EOS>
And I would have it suddenly perform'd. <EOS>
What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Your grace may do your pleasure. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth: <EOS>
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord <EOS>
Before I positively herein: <EOS>
I will resolve your grace immediately. <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
I will converse with iron-witted fools <EOS>
And unrespective boys: none are for me <EOS>
That look into me with considerate eyes: <EOS>
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect. <EOS>
Boy! <EOS>
Page: <EOS>
My lord? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold <EOS>
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death? <EOS>
Page: <EOS>
My lord, I know a discontented gentleman, <EOS>
Whose humble means match not his haughty mind: <EOS>
Gold were as good as twenty orators, <EOS>
And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
What is his name? <EOS>
Page: <EOS>
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
I partly know the man: go, call him hither. <EOS>
The deep-revolving witty Buckingham <EOS>
No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel: <EOS>
Hath he so long held out with me untired, <EOS>
And stops he now for breath? <EOS>
How now! what news with you? <EOS>
STANLEY: <EOS>
My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled <EOS>
To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea <EOS>
Where he abides. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Catesby! <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
My lord? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Rumour it abroad <EOS>
That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die: <EOS>
I will take order for her keeping close. <EOS>
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman, <EOS>
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter: <EOS>
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him. <EOS>
Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out <EOS>
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die: <EOS>
About it; for it stands me much upon, <EOS>
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me. <EOS>
I must be married to my brother's daughter, <EOS>
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass. <EOS>
Murder her brothers, and then marry her! <EOS>
Uncertain way of gain! But I am in <EOS>
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin: <EOS>
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye. <EOS>
Is thy name Tyrrel? <EOS>
TYRREL: <EOS>
James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Art thou, indeed? <EOS>
TYRREL: <EOS>
Prove me, my gracious sovereign. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine? <EOS>
TYRREL: <EOS>
Ay, my lord; <EOS>
But I had rather kill two enemies. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies, <EOS>
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers <EOS>
Are they that I would have thee deal upon: <EOS>
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower. <EOS>
TYRREL: <EOS>
Let me have open means to come to them, <EOS>
And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel <EOS>
Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear: <EOS>
There is no more but so: say it is done, <EOS>
And I will love thee, and prefer thee too. <EOS>
TYRREL: <EOS>
'Tis done, my gracious lord. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep? <EOS>
TYRREL: <EOS>
Ye shall, my Lord. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind <EOS>
The late demand that you did sound me in. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
I hear that news, my lord. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise, <EOS>
For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd; <EOS>
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables <EOS>
The which you promised I should possess. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey <EOS>
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
What says your highness to my just demand? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
As I remember, Henry the Sixth <EOS>
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king, <EOS>
When Richmond was a little peevish boy. <EOS>
A king, perhaps, perhaps,-- <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
My lord! <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
How chance the prophet could not at that time <EOS>
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
My lord, your promise for the earldom,-- <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Richmond! When last I was at Exeter, <EOS>
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle, <EOS>
And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started, <EOS>
Because a bard of Ireland told me once <EOS>
I should not live long after I saw Richmond. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
My Lord! <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Ay, what's o'clock? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
I am thus bold to put your grace in mind <EOS>
Of what you promised me. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Well, but what's o'clock? <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Upon the stroke of ten. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Well, let it strike. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Why let it strike? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke <EOS>
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation. <EOS>
I am not in the giving vein to-day. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Why, then resolve me whether you will or no. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Tut, tut, <EOS>
Thou troublest me; am not in the vein. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Is it even so? rewards he my true service <EOS>
With such deep contempt made I him king for this? <EOS>
O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone <EOS>
To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on! <EOS>
TYRREL: <EOS>
The tyrannous and bloody deed is done. <EOS>
The most arch of piteous massacre <EOS>
That ever yet this land was guilty of. <EOS>
Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn <EOS>
To do this ruthless piece of butchery, <EOS>
Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs, <EOS>
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion <EOS>
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories. <EOS>
'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:' <EOS>
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another <EOS>
Within their innocent alabaster arms: <EOS>
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk, <EOS>
Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other. <EOS>
A book of prayers on their pillow lay; <EOS>
Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind; <EOS>
But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd <EOS>
Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered <EOS>
The most replenished sweet work of nature, <EOS>
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.' <EOS>
Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse; <EOS>
They could not speak; and so I left them both, <EOS>
To bring this tidings to the bloody king. <EOS>
And here he comes. <EOS>
All hail, my sovereign liege! <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news? <EOS>
TYRREL: <EOS>
If to have done the thing you gave in charge <EOS>
Beget your happiness, be happy then, <EOS>
For it is done, my lord. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
But didst thou see them dead? <EOS>
TYRREL: <EOS>
I did, my lord. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
And buried, gentle Tyrrel? <EOS>
TYRREL: <EOS>
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them; <EOS>
But how or in what place I do not know. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper, <EOS>
And thou shalt tell the process of their death. <EOS>
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good, <EOS>
And be inheritor of thy desire. <EOS>
Farewell till soon. <EOS>
The son of Clarence have I pent up close; <EOS>
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage; <EOS>
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom, <EOS>
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night. <EOS>
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims <EOS>
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter, <EOS>
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown, <EOS>
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer. <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
My lord! <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly? <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond; <EOS>
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen, <EOS>
Is in the field, and still his power increaseth. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near <EOS>
Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army. <EOS>
Come, I have heard that fearful commenting <EOS>
Is leaden servitor to dull delay; <EOS>
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary <EOS>
Then fiery expedition be my wing, <EOS>
Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king! <EOS>
Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield; <EOS>
We must be brief when traitors brave the field. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
So, now prosperity begins to mellow <EOS>
And drop into the rotten mouth of death. <EOS>
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd, <EOS>
To watch the waning of mine adversaries. <EOS>
A dire induction am I witness to, <EOS>
And will to France, hoping the consequence <EOS>
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical. <EOS>
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes! <EOS>
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets! <EOS>
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air <EOS>
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual, <EOS>
Hover about me with your airy wings <EOS>
And hear your mother's lamentation! <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Hover about her; say, that right for right <EOS>
Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
So many miseries have crazed my voice, <EOS>
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb, <EOS>
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet. <EOS>
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs, <EOS>
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf? <EOS>
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
When holy Harry died, and my sweet son. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost, <EOS>
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd, <EOS>
Brief abstract and record of tedious days, <EOS>
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth, <EOS>
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood! <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave <EOS>
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat! <EOS>
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here. <EOS>
O, who hath any cause to mourn but I? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
If ancient sorrow be most reverend, <EOS>
Give mine the benefit of seniory, <EOS>
And let my woes frown on the upper hand. <EOS>
If sorrow can admit society, <EOS>
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine: <EOS>
I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him; <EOS>
I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him: <EOS>
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him; <EOS>
Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him; <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him; <EOS>
I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him. <EOS>
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept <EOS>
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death: <EOS>
That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes, <EOS>
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood, <EOS>
That foul defacer of God's handiwork, <EOS>
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth, <EOS>
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls, <EOS>
Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves. <EOS>
O upright, just, and true-disposing God, <EOS>
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur <EOS>
Preys on the issue of his mother's body, <EOS>
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan! <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes! <EOS>
God witness with me, I have wept for thine. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge, <EOS>
And now I cloy me with beholding it. <EOS>
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward: <EOS>
Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward; <EOS>
Young York he is but boot, because both they <EOS>
Match not the high perfection of my loss: <EOS>
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward; <EOS>
And the beholders of this tragic play, <EOS>
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey, <EOS>
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves. <EOS>
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer, <EOS>
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls <EOS>
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand, <EOS>
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end: <EOS>
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray. <EOS>
To have him suddenly convey'd away. <EOS>
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey, <EOS>
That I may live to say, The dog is dead! <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come <EOS>
That I should wish for thee to help me curse <EOS>
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad! <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune; <EOS>
I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen; <EOS>
The presentation of but what I was; <EOS>
The flattering index of a direful pageant; <EOS>
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below; <EOS>
A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes; <EOS>
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble, <EOS>
A sign of dignity, a garish flag, <EOS>
To be the aim of every dangerous shot, <EOS>
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene. <EOS>
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers? <EOS>
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy? <EOS>
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'? <EOS>
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee? <EOS>
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee? <EOS>
Decline all this, and see what now thou art: <EOS>
For happy wife, a most distressed widow; <EOS>
For joyful mother, one that wails the name; <EOS>
For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care; <EOS>
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues; <EOS>
For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me; <EOS>
For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one; <EOS>
For one commanding all, obey'd of none. <EOS>
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about, <EOS>
And left thee but a very prey to time; <EOS>
Having no more but thought of what thou wert, <EOS>
To torture thee the more, being what thou art. <EOS>
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not <EOS>
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow? <EOS>
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke; <EOS>
From which even here I slip my weary neck, <EOS>
And leave the burthen of it all on thee. <EOS>
Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance: <EOS>
These English woes will make me smile in France. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile, <EOS>
And teach me how to curse mine enemies! <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days; <EOS>
Compare dead happiness with living woe; <EOS>
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were, <EOS>
And he that slew them fouler than he is: <EOS>
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse: <EOS>
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine! <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Why should calamity be full of words? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Windy attorneys to their client woes, <EOS>
Airy succeeders of intestate joys, <EOS>
Poor breathing orators of miseries! <EOS>
Let them have scope: though what they do impart <EOS>
Help not all, yet do they ease the heart. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me. <EOS>
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother <EOS>
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd. <EOS>
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Who intercepts my expedition? <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
O, she that might have intercepted thee, <EOS>
By strangling thee in her accursed womb <EOS>
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done! <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown, <EOS>
Where should be graven, if that right were right, <EOS>
The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown, <EOS>
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers? <EOS>
Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children? <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence? <EOS>
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums! <EOS>
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women <EOS>
Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say! <EOS>
Either be patient, and entreat me fair, <EOS>
Or with the clamorous report of war <EOS>
Thus will I drown your exclamations. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Art thou my son? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Then patiently hear my impatience. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Madam, I have a touch of your condition, <EOS>
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
O, let me speak! <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Do then: but I'll not hear. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
I will be mild and gentle in my speech. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
And brief, good mother; for I am in haste. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee, <EOS>
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
And came I not at last to comfort you? <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well, <EOS>
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell. <EOS>
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me; <EOS>
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy; <EOS>
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious, <EOS>
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous, <EOS>
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody, <EOS>
treacherous, <EOS>
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred: <EOS>
What comfortable hour canst thou name, <EOS>
That ever graced me in thy company? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd <EOS>
your grace <EOS>
To breakfast once forth of my company. <EOS>
If I be so disgracious in your sight, <EOS>
Let me march on, and not offend your grace. <EOS>
Strike the drum. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
I prithee, hear me speak. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
You speak too bitterly. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Hear me a word; <EOS>
For I shall never speak to thee again. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
So. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance, <EOS>
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror, <EOS>
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish <EOS>
And never look upon thy face again. <EOS>
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse; <EOS>
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more <EOS>
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st! <EOS>
My prayers on the adverse party fight; <EOS>
And there the little souls of Edward's children <EOS>
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies <EOS>
And promise them success and victory. <EOS>
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end; <EOS>
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse <EOS>
Abides in me; I say amen to all. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
I have no more sons of the royal blood <EOS>
For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard, <EOS>
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens; <EOS>
And therefore level not to hit their lives. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth, <EOS>
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
And must she die for this? O, let her live, <EOS>
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty; <EOS>
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed; <EOS>
Throw over her the veil of infamy: <EOS>
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter, <EOS>
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
To save her life, I'll say she is not so. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Her life is only safest in her birth. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
And only in that safety died her brothers. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Lo, at their births good stars were opposite. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
No, to their lives bad friends were contrary. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
All unavoided is the doom of destiny. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
True, when avoided grace makes destiny: <EOS>
My babes were destined to a fairer death, <EOS>
If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd <EOS>
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life. <EOS>
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts, <EOS>
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction: <EOS>
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt <EOS>
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart, <EOS>
To revel in the entrails of my lambs. <EOS>
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame, <EOS>
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys <EOS>
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes; <EOS>
And I, in such a desperate bay of death, <EOS>
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft, <EOS>
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise <EOS>
And dangerous success of bloody wars, <EOS>
As I intend more good to you and yours, <EOS>
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd! <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
What good is cover'd with the face of heaven, <EOS>
To be discover'd, that can do me good? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
The advancement of your children, gentle lady. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
No, to the dignity and height of honour <EOS>
The high imperial type of this earth's glory. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Flatter my sorrows with report of it; <EOS>
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour, <EOS>
Canst thou demise to any child of mine? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Even all I have; yea, and myself and all, <EOS>
Will I withal endow a child of thine; <EOS>
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul <EOS>
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs <EOS>
Which thou supposest I have done to thee. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness <EOS>
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
What do you think? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul: <EOS>
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers; <EOS>
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning: <EOS>
I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter, <EOS>
And mean to make her queen of England. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Even he that makes her queen who should be else? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
What, thou? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
I, even I: what think you of it, madam? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
How canst thou woo her? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
That would I learn of you, <EOS>
As one that are best acquainted with her humour. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
And wilt thou learn of me? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Madam, with all my heart. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers, <EOS>
A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave <EOS>
Edward and York; then haply she will weep: <EOS>
Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret <EOS>
Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,-- <EOS>
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain <EOS>
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body <EOS>
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith. <EOS>
If this inducement force her not to love, <EOS>
Send her a story of thy noble acts; <EOS>
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence, <EOS>
Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake, <EOS>
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way <EOS>
To win our daughter. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
There is no other way <EOS>
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape, <EOS>
And not be Richard that hath done all this. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Say that I did all this for love of her. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee, <EOS>
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Look, what is done cannot be now amended: <EOS>
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes, <EOS>
Which after hours give leisure to repent. <EOS>
If I did take the kingdom from your sons, <EOS>
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter. <EOS>
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb, <EOS>
To quicken your increase, I will beget <EOS>
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter <EOS>
A grandam's name is little less in love <EOS>
Than is the doting title of a mother; <EOS>
They are as children but one step below, <EOS>
Even of your mettle, of your very blood; <EOS>
Of an one pain, save for a night of groans <EOS>
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow. <EOS>
Your children were vexation to your youth, <EOS>
But mine shall be a comfort to your age. <EOS>
The loss you have is but a son being king, <EOS>
And by that loss your daughter is made queen. <EOS>
I cannot make you what amends I would, <EOS>
Therefore accept such kindness as I can. <EOS>
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul <EOS>
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil, <EOS>
This fair alliance quickly shall call home <EOS>
To high promotions and great dignity: <EOS>
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife. <EOS>
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother; <EOS>
Again shall you be mother to a king, <EOS>
And all the ruins of distressful times <EOS>
Repair'd with double riches of content. <EOS>
What! we have many goodly days to see: <EOS>
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed <EOS>
Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl, <EOS>
Advantaging their loan with interest <EOS>
Of ten times double gain of happiness. <EOS>
Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go <EOS>
Make bold her bashful years with your experience; <EOS>
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale <EOS>
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame <EOS>
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess <EOS>
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys <EOS>
And when this arm of mine hath chastised <EOS>
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham, <EOS>
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come <EOS>
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed; <EOS>
To whom I will retail my conquest won, <EOS>
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
What were I best to say? her father's brother <EOS>
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle? <EOS>
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles? <EOS>
Under what title shall I woo for thee, <EOS>
That God, the law, my honour and her love, <EOS>
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Infer fair England's peace by this alliance. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Which she shall purchase with still lasting war. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Say that the king, which may command, entreats. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
That at her hands which the king's King forbids. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
To wail the tide, as her mother doth. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Say, I will love her everlastingly. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
But how long shall that title 'ever' last? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
So long as heaven and nature lengthens it. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
So long as hell and Richard likes of it. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Be eloquent in my behalf to her. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
O no, my reasons are too deep and dead; <EOS>
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Harp not on that string, madam; that is past. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,-- <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
I swear-- <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
By nothing; for this is no oath: <EOS>
The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour; <EOS>
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue; <EOS>
The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory. <EOS>
if something thou wilt swear to be believed, <EOS>
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Now, by the world-- <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
'Tis full of thy foul wrongs. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
My father's death-- <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Thy life hath that dishonour'd. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Then, by myself-- <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Thyself thyself misusest. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Why then, by God-- <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
God's wrong is most of all. <EOS>
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him, <EOS>
The unity the king thy brother made <EOS>
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain: <EOS>
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him, <EOS>
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow, <EOS>
Had graced the tender temples of my child, <EOS>
And both the princes had been breathing here, <EOS>
Which now, two tender playfellows to dust, <EOS>
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms. <EOS>
What canst thou swear by now? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
The time to come. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast; <EOS>
For I myself have many tears to wash <EOS>
Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee. <EOS>
The children live, whose parents thou hast <EOS>
slaughter'd, <EOS>
Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age; <EOS>
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd, <EOS>
Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age. <EOS>
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast <EOS>
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
As I intend to prosper and repent, <EOS>
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt <EOS>
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound! <EOS>
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours! <EOS>
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest! <EOS>
Be opposite all planets of good luck <EOS>
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love, <EOS>
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts, <EOS>
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter! <EOS>
In her consists my happiness and thine; <EOS>
Without her, follows to this land and me, <EOS>
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul, <EOS>
Death, desolation, ruin and decay: <EOS>
It cannot be avoided but by this; <EOS>
It will not be avoided but by this. <EOS>
Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so-- <EOS>
Be the attorney of my love to her: <EOS>
Plead what I will be, not what I have been; <EOS>
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve: <EOS>
Urge the necessity and state of times, <EOS>
And be not peevish-fond in great designs. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Shall I forget myself to be myself? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
But thou didst kill my children. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
But in your daughter's womb I bury them: <EOS>
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed <EOS>
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
And be a happy mother by the deed. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
I go. Write to me very shortly. <EOS>
And you shall understand from me her mind. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell. <EOS>
Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman! <EOS>
How now! what news? <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
My gracious sovereign, on the western coast <EOS>
Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore <EOS>
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends, <EOS>
Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back: <EOS>
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral; <EOS>
And there they hull, expecting but the aid <EOS>
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk: <EOS>
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he? <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
Here, my lord. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Fly to the duke: <EOS>
Post thou to Salisbury <EOS>
When thou comest thither-- <EOS>
Dull, unmindful villain, <EOS>
Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke? <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind, <EOS>
What from your grace I shall deliver to him. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight <EOS>
The greatest strength and power he can make, <EOS>
And meet me presently at Salisbury. <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
I go. <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at <EOS>
Salisbury? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go? <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
Your highness told me I should post before. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed. <EOS>
How now, what news with you? <EOS>
STANLEY: <EOS>
None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing; <EOS>
Nor none so bad, but it may well be told. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad! <EOS>
Why dost thou run so many mile about, <EOS>
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way? <EOS>
Once more, what news? <EOS>
STANLEY: <EOS>
Richmond is on the seas. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
There let him sink, and be the seas on him! <EOS>
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there? <EOS>
STANLEY: <EOS>
I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess? <EOS>
STANLEY: <EOS>
Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely, <EOS>
He makes for England, there to claim the crown. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd? <EOS>
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd? <EOS>
What heir of York is there alive but we? <EOS>
And who is England's king but great York's heir? <EOS>
Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea? <EOS>
STANLEY: <EOS>
Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Unless for that he comes to be your liege, <EOS>
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes. <EOS>
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear. <EOS>
STANLEY: <EOS>
No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back? <EOS>
Where are thy tenants and thy followers? <EOS>
Are they not now upon the western shore. <EOS>
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships! <EOS>
STANLEY: <EOS>
No, my good lord, my friends are in the north. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north, <EOS>
When they should serve their sovereign in the west? <EOS>
STANLEY: <EOS>
They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign: <EOS>
Please it your majesty to give me leave, <EOS>
I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace <EOS>
Where and what time your majesty shall please. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond: <EOS>
I will not trust you, sir. <EOS>
STANLEY: <EOS>
Most mighty sovereign, <EOS>
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful: <EOS>
I never was nor never will be false. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Well, <EOS>
Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind <EOS>
Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm. <EOS>
Or else his head's assurance is but frail. <EOS>
STANLEY: <EOS>
So deal with him as I prove true to you. <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire, <EOS>
As I by friends am well advertised, <EOS>
Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate <EOS>
Bishop of Exeter, his brother there, <EOS>
With many more confederates, are in arms. <EOS>
Second Messenger: <EOS>
My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms; <EOS>
And every hour more competitors <EOS>
Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth. <EOS>
Third Messenger: <EOS>
My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham-- <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death? <EOS>
Take that, until thou bring me better news. <EOS>
Third Messenger: <EOS>
The news I have to tell your majesty <EOS>
Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters, <EOS>
Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd; <EOS>
And he himself wander'd away alone, <EOS>
No man knows whither. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
I cry thee mercy: <EOS>
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine. <EOS>
Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd <EOS>
Reward to him that brings the traitor in? <EOS>
Third Messenger: <EOS>
Such proclamation hath been made, my liege. <EOS>
Fourth Messenger: <EOS>
Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset, <EOS>
'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms. <EOS>
Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace, <EOS>
The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest: <EOS>
Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat <EOS>
Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks <EOS>
If they were his assistants, yea or no; <EOS>
Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham. <EOS>
Upon his party: he, mistrusting them, <EOS>
Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
March on, march on, since we are up in arms; <EOS>
If not to fight with foreign enemies, <EOS>
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home. <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken; <EOS>
That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond <EOS>
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford, <EOS>
Is colder tidings, yet they must be told. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here, <EOS>
A royal battle might be won and lost <EOS>
Some one take order Buckingham be brought <EOS>
To Salisbury; the rest march on with me. <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me: <EOS>
That in the sty of this most bloody boar <EOS>
My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold: <EOS>
If I revolt, off goes young George's head; <EOS>
The fear of that withholds my present aid. <EOS>
But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now? <EOS>
CHRISTOPHER: <EOS>
At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales. <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
What men of name resort to him? <EOS>
CHRISTOPHER: <EOS>
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier; <EOS>
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley; <EOS>
Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt, <EOS>
And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew; <EOS>
And many more of noble fame and worth: <EOS>
And towards London they do bend their course, <EOS>
If by the way they be not fought withal. <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
Return unto thy lord; commend me to him: <EOS>
Tell him the queen hath heartily consented <EOS>
He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter. <EOS>
These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Will not King Richard let me speak with him? <EOS>
Sheriff: <EOS>
No, my good lord; therefore be patient. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey, <EOS>
Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward, <EOS>
Vaughan, and all that have miscarried <EOS>
By underhand corrupted foul injustice, <EOS>
If that your moody discontented souls <EOS>
Do through the clouds behold this present hour, <EOS>
Even for revenge mock my destruction! <EOS>
This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not? <EOS>
Sheriff: <EOS>
It is, my lord. <EOS>
BUCKINGHAM: <EOS>
Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday. <EOS>
This is the day that, in King Edward's time, <EOS>
I wish't might fall on me, when I was found <EOS>
False to his children or his wife's allies <EOS>
This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall <EOS>
By the false faith of him I trusted most; <EOS>
This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul <EOS>
Is the determined respite of my wrongs: <EOS>
That high All-Seer that I dallied with <EOS>
Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head <EOS>
And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest. <EOS>
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men <EOS>
To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms: <EOS>
Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head; <EOS>
'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow, <EOS>
Remember Margaret was a prophetess.' <EOS>
Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame; <EOS>
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame. <EOS>
RICHMOND: <EOS>
Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends, <EOS>
Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny, <EOS>
Thus far into the bowels of the land <EOS>
Have we march'd on without impediment; <EOS>
And here receive we from our father Stanley <EOS>
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement. <EOS>
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar, <EOS>
That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines, <EOS>
Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough <EOS>
In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine <EOS>
Lies now even in the centre of this isle, <EOS>
Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn <EOS>
From Tamworth thither is but one day's march. <EOS>
In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends, <EOS>
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace <EOS>
By this one bloody trial of sharp war. <EOS>
OXFORD: <EOS>
Every man's conscience is a thousand swords, <EOS>
To fight against that bloody homicide. <EOS>
HERBERT: <EOS>
I doubt not but his friends will fly to us. <EOS>
BLUNT: <EOS>
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear. <EOS>
Which in his greatest need will shrink from him. <EOS>
RICHMOND: <EOS>
All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march: <EOS>
True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings: <EOS>
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field. <EOS>
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad? <EOS>
SURREY: <EOS>
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
My Lord of Norfolk,-- <EOS>
NORFOLK: <EOS>
Here, most gracious liege. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not? <EOS>
NORFOLK: <EOS>
We must both give and take, my gracious lord. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight; <EOS>
But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that. <EOS>
Who hath descried the number of the foe? <EOS>
NORFOLK: <EOS>
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Why, our battalion trebles that account: <EOS>
Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength, <EOS>
Which they upon the adverse party want. <EOS>
Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen, <EOS>
Let us survey the vantage of the field <EOS>
Call for some men of sound direction <EOS>
Let's want no discipline, make no delay, <EOS>
For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day. <EOS>
RICHMOND: <EOS>
The weary sun hath made a golden set, <EOS>
And by the bright track of his fiery car, <EOS>
Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow. <EOS>
Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard. <EOS>
Give me some ink and paper in my tent <EOS>
I'll draw the form and model of our battle, <EOS>
Limit each leader to his several charge, <EOS>
And part in just proportion our small strength. <EOS>
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon, <EOS>
And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me. <EOS>
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment: <EOS>
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him <EOS>
And by the second hour in the morning <EOS>
Desire the earl to see me in my tent: <EOS>
Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st, <EOS>
Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know? <EOS>
BLUNT: <EOS>
Unless I have mista'en his colours much, <EOS>
Which well I am assured I have not done, <EOS>
His regiment lies half a mile at least <EOS>
South from the mighty power of the king. <EOS>
RICHMOND: <EOS>
If without peril it be possible, <EOS>
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him, <EOS>
And give him from me this most needful scroll. <EOS>
BLUNT: <EOS>
Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it; <EOS>
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night! <EOS>
RICHMOND: <EOS>
Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen, <EOS>
Let us consult upon to-morrow's business <EOS>
In to our tent; the air is raw and cold. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
What is't o'clock? <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
It's supper-time, my lord; <EOS>
It's nine o'clock. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
I will not sup to-night. <EOS>
Give me some ink and paper. <EOS>
What, is my beaver easier than it was? <EOS>
And all my armour laid into my tent? <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge; <EOS>
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels. <EOS>
NORFOLK: <EOS>
I go, my lord. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk. <EOS>
NORFOLK: <EOS>
I warrant you, my lord. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Catesby! <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
My lord? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Send out a pursuivant at arms <EOS>
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power <EOS>
Before sunrising, lest his son George fall <EOS>
Into the blind cave of eternal night. <EOS>
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch. <EOS>
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow. <EOS>
Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy. <EOS>
Ratcliff! <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
My lord? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland? <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself, <EOS>
Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop <EOS>
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine: <EOS>
I have not that alacrity of spirit, <EOS>
Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have. <EOS>
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready? <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
It is, my lord. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Bid my guard watch; leave me. <EOS>
Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent <EOS>
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say. <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm! <EOS>
RICHMOND: <EOS>
All comfort that the dark night can afford <EOS>
Be to thy person, noble father-in-law! <EOS>
Tell me, how fares our loving mother? <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother <EOS>
Who prays continually for Richmond's good: <EOS>
So much for that. The silent hours steal on, <EOS>
And flaky darkness breaks within the east. <EOS>
In brief,--for so the season bids us be,-- <EOS>
Prepare thy battle early in the morning, <EOS>
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement <EOS>
Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war. <EOS>
I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,-- <EOS>
With best advantage will deceive the time, <EOS>
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms: <EOS>
But on thy side I may not be too forward <EOS>
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George, <EOS>
Be executed in his father's sight. <EOS>
Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time <EOS>
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love <EOS>
And ample interchange of sweet discourse, <EOS>
Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon: <EOS>
God give us leisure for these rites of love! <EOS>
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well! <EOS>
RICHMOND: <EOS>
Good lords, conduct him to his regiment: <EOS>
I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap, <EOS>
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow, <EOS>
When I should mount with wings of victory: <EOS>
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen. <EOS>
O Thou, whose captain I account myself, <EOS>
Look on my forces with a gracious eye; <EOS>
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath, <EOS>
That they may crush down with a heavy fall <EOS>
The usurping helmets of our adversaries! <EOS>
Make us thy ministers of chastisement, <EOS>
That we may praise thee in the victory! <EOS>
To thee I do commend my watchful soul, <EOS>
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes: <EOS>
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still! <EOS>
Ghost of Prince Edward: <EOS>
Ghost of King Henry VI: <EOS>
Ghost of CLARENCE: <EOS>
Ghost of RIVERS: <EOS>
Ghost of GREY: <EOS>
Ghost of VAUGHAN: <EOS>

Ghost of HASTINGS: <EOS>
Ghosts of young Princes: <EOS>

KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Give me another horse: bind up my wounds. <EOS>
Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream. <EOS>
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me! <EOS>
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight. <EOS>
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh. <EOS>
What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by: <EOS>
Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I. <EOS>
Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am: <EOS>
Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why: <EOS>
Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself? <EOS>
Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good <EOS>
That I myself have done unto myself? <EOS>
O, no! alas, I rather hate myself <EOS>
For hateful deeds committed by myself! <EOS>
I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not. <EOS>
Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter. <EOS>
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues, <EOS>
And every tongue brings in a several tale, <EOS>
And every tale condemns me for a villain. <EOS>
Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree <EOS>
Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree; <EOS>
All several sins, all used in each degree, <EOS>
Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty! <EOS>
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me; <EOS>
And if I die, no soul shall pity me: <EOS>
Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself <EOS>
Find in myself no pity to myself? <EOS>
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd <EOS>
Came to my tent; and every one did threat <EOS>
To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard. <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
My lord! <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
'Zounds! who is there? <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock <EOS>
Hath twice done salutation to the morn; <EOS>
Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream! <EOS>
What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true? <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
No doubt, my lord. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,-- <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night <EOS>
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard <EOS>
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers <EOS>
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond. <EOS>
It is not yet near day. Come, go with me; <EOS>
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper, <EOS>
To see if any mean to shrink from me. <EOS>
LORDS: <EOS>
Good morrow, Richmond! <EOS>
RICHMOND: <EOS>
Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen, <EOS>
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here. <EOS>
LORDS: <EOS>
How have you slept, my lord? <EOS>
RICHMOND: <EOS>
The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams <EOS>
That ever enter'd in a drowsy head, <EOS>
Have I since your departure had, my lords. <EOS>
Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd, <EOS>
Came to my tent, and cried on victory: <EOS>
I promise you, my soul is very jocund <EOS>
In the remembrance of so fair a dream. <EOS>
How far into the morning is it, lords? <EOS>
LORDS: <EOS>
Upon the stroke of four. <EOS>
RICHMOND: <EOS>
Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction. <EOS>
More than I have said, loving countrymen, <EOS>
The leisure and enforcement of the time <EOS>
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this, <EOS>
God and our good cause fight upon our side; <EOS>
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls, <EOS>
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces; <EOS>
Richard except, those whom we fight against <EOS>
Had rather have us win than him they follow: <EOS>
For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen, <EOS>
A bloody tyrant and a homicide; <EOS>
One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd; <EOS>
One that made means to come by what he hath, <EOS>
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him; <EOS>
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil <EOS>
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set; <EOS>
One that hath ever been God's enemy: <EOS>
Then, if you fight against God's enemy, <EOS>
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers; <EOS>
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down, <EOS>
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain; <EOS>
If you do fight against your country's foes, <EOS>
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire; <EOS>
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives, <EOS>
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors; <EOS>
If you do free your children from the sword, <EOS>
Your children's children quit it in your age. <EOS>
Then, in the name of God and all these rights, <EOS>
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords. <EOS>
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt <EOS>
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face; <EOS>
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt <EOS>
The least of you shall share his part thereof. <EOS>
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully; <EOS>
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory! <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond? <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
That he was never trained up in arms. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
He said the truth: and what said Surrey then? <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.' <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
He was in the right; and so indeed it is. <EOS>
Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar. <EOS>
Who saw the sun to-day? <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
Not I, my lord. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Then he disdains to shine; for by the book <EOS>
He should have braved the east an hour ago <EOS>
A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff! <EOS>
RATCLIFF: <EOS>
My lord? <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
The sun will not be seen to-day; <EOS>
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army. <EOS>
I would these dewy tears were from the ground. <EOS>
Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me <EOS>
More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven <EOS>
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him. <EOS>
NORFOLK: <EOS>
Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse. <EOS>
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power: <EOS>
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain, <EOS>
And thus my battle shall be ordered: <EOS>
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length, <EOS>
Consisting equally of horse and foot; <EOS>
Our archers shall be placed in the midst <EOS>
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey, <EOS>
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse. <EOS>
They thus directed, we will follow <EOS>
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side <EOS>
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse. <EOS>
This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk? <EOS>
NORFOLK: <EOS>
A good direction, warlike sovereign. <EOS>
This found I on my tent this morning. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
My lord, he doth deny to come. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Off with his son George's head! <EOS>
NORFOLK: <EOS>
My lord, the enemy is past the marsh <EOS>
After the battle let George Stanley die. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom: <EOS>
Advance our standards, set upon our foes <EOS>
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George, <EOS>
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons! <EOS>
Upon them! victory sits on our helms. <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue! <EOS>
The king enacts more wonders than a man, <EOS>
Daring an opposite to every danger: <EOS>
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights, <EOS>
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death. <EOS>
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost! <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! <EOS>
CATESBY: <EOS>
Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse. <EOS>
KING RICHARD III: <EOS>
Slave, I have set my life upon a cast, <EOS>
And I will stand the hazard of the die: <EOS>
I think there be six Richmonds in the field; <EOS>
Five have I slain to-day instead of him. <EOS>
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! <EOS>
RICHMOND: <EOS>
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends, <EOS>
The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead. <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee. <EOS>
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty <EOS>
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch <EOS>
Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal: <EOS>
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it. <EOS>
RICHMOND: <EOS>
Great God of heaven, say Amen to all! <EOS>
But, tell me, is young George Stanley living? <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town; <EOS>
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us. <EOS>
RICHMOND: <EOS>
What men of name are slain on either side? <EOS>
DERBY: <EOS>
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers, <EOS>
Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon. <EOS>
RICHMOND: <EOS>
Inter their bodies as becomes their births: <EOS>
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled <EOS>
That in submission will return to us: <EOS>
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament, <EOS>
We will unite the white rose and the red: <EOS>
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction, <EOS>
That long have frown'd upon their enmity! <EOS>
What traitor hears me, and says not amen? <EOS>
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself; <EOS>
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood, <EOS>
The father rashly slaughter'd his own son, <EOS>
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire: <EOS>
All this divided York and Lancaster, <EOS>
Divided in their dire division, <EOS>
O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth, <EOS>
The true succeeders of each royal house, <EOS>
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together! <EOS>
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so. <EOS>
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace, <EOS>
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days! <EOS>
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord, <EOS>
That would reduce these bloody days again, <EOS>
And make poor England weep in streams of blood! <EOS>
Let them not live to taste this land's increase <EOS>
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace! <EOS>
Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again: <EOS>
That she may long live here, God say amen! <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster, <EOS>
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band, <EOS>
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son, <EOS>
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal, <EOS>
Which then our leisure would not let us hear, <EOS>
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
I have, my liege. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him, <EOS>
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice; <EOS>
Or worthily, as a good subject should, <EOS>
On some known ground of treachery in him? <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
As near as I could sift him on that argument, <EOS>
On some apparent danger seen in him <EOS>
Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Then call them to our presence; face to face, <EOS>
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear <EOS>
The accuser and the accused freely speak: <EOS>
High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire, <EOS>
In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Many years of happy days befal <EOS>
My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege! <EOS>
THOMAS MOWBRAY: <EOS>
Each day still better other's happiness; <EOS>
Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap, <EOS>
Add an immortal title to your crown! <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
We thank you both: yet one but flatters us, <EOS>
As well appeareth by the cause you come; <EOS>
Namely to appeal each other of high treason. <EOS>
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object <EOS>
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
First, heaven be the record to my speech! <EOS>
In the devotion of a subject's love, <EOS>
Tendering the precious safety of my prince, <EOS>
And free from other misbegotten hate, <EOS>
Come I appellant to this princely presence. <EOS>
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee, <EOS>
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak <EOS>
My body shall make good upon this earth, <EOS>
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven. <EOS>
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant, <EOS>
Too good to be so and too bad to live, <EOS>
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky, <EOS>
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly. <EOS>
Once more, the more to aggravate the note, <EOS>
With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat; <EOS>
And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move, <EOS>
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove. <EOS>
THOMAS MOWBRAY: <EOS>
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal: <EOS>
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war, <EOS>
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues, <EOS>
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain; <EOS>
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this: <EOS>
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast <EOS>
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say: <EOS>
First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me <EOS>
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech; <EOS>
Which else would post until it had return'd <EOS>
These terms of treason doubled down his throat. <EOS>
Setting aside his high blood's royalty, <EOS>
And let him be no kinsman to my liege, <EOS>
I do defy him, and I spit at him; <EOS>
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain: <EOS>
Which to maintain I would allow him odds, <EOS>
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot <EOS>
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps, <EOS>
Or any other ground inhabitable, <EOS>
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot. <EOS>
Mean time let this defend my loyalty, <EOS>
By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage, <EOS>
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king, <EOS>
And lay aside my high blood's royalty, <EOS>
Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except. <EOS>
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength <EOS>
As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop: <EOS>
By that and all the rites of knighthood else, <EOS>
Will I make good against thee, arm to arm, <EOS>
What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise. <EOS>
THOMAS MOWBRAY: <EOS>
I take it up; and by that sword I swear <EOS>
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder, <EOS>
I'll answer thee in any fair degree, <EOS>
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial: <EOS>
And when I mount, alive may I not light, <EOS>
If I be traitor or unjustly fight! <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge? <EOS>
It must be great that can inherit us <EOS>
So much as of a thought of ill in him. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true; <EOS>
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles <EOS>
In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers, <EOS>
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments, <EOS>
Like a false traitor and injurious villain. <EOS>
Besides I say and will in battle prove, <EOS>
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge <EOS>
That ever was survey'd by English eye, <EOS>
That all the treasons for these eighteen years <EOS>
Complotted and contrived in this land <EOS>
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring. <EOS>
Further I say and further will maintain <EOS>
Upon his bad life to make all this good, <EOS>
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death, <EOS>
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries, <EOS>
And consequently, like a traitor coward, <EOS>
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood: <EOS>
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries, <EOS>
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth, <EOS>
To me for justice and rough chastisement; <EOS>
And, by the glorious worth of my descent, <EOS>
This arm shall do it, or this life be spent. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
How high a pitch his resolution soars! <EOS>
Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this? <EOS>
THOMAS MOWBRAY: <EOS>
O, let my sovereign turn away his face <EOS>
And bid his ears a little while be deaf, <EOS>
Till I have told this slander of his blood, <EOS>
How God and good men hate so foul a liar. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears: <EOS>
Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir, <EOS>
As he is but my father's brother's son, <EOS>
Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow, <EOS>
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood <EOS>
Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize <EOS>
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul: <EOS>
He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou: <EOS>
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow. <EOS>
THOMAS MOWBRAY: <EOS>
Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart, <EOS>
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest. <EOS>
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais <EOS>
Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers; <EOS>
The other part reserved I by consent, <EOS>
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt <EOS>
Upon remainder of a dear account, <EOS>
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen: <EOS>
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death, <EOS>
I slew him not; but to my own disgrace <EOS>
Neglected my sworn duty in that case. <EOS>
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster, <EOS>
The honourable father to my foe <EOS>
Once did I lay an ambush for your life, <EOS>
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul <EOS>
But ere I last received the sacrament <EOS>
I did confess it, and exactly begg'd <EOS>
Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it. <EOS>
This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd, <EOS>
It issues from the rancour of a villain, <EOS>
A recreant and most degenerate traitor <EOS>
Which in myself I boldly will defend; <EOS>
And interchangeably hurl down my gage <EOS>
Upon this overweening traitor's foot, <EOS>
To prove myself a loyal gentleman <EOS>
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom. <EOS>
In haste whereof, most heartily I pray <EOS>
Your highness to assign our trial day. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me; <EOS>
Let's purge this choler without letting blood: <EOS>
This we prescribe, though no physician; <EOS>
Deep malice makes too deep incision; <EOS>
Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed; <EOS>
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed. <EOS>
Good uncle, let this end where it begun; <EOS>
We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
To be a make-peace shall become my age: <EOS>
Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
And, Norfolk, throw down his. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
When, Harry, when? <EOS>
Obedience bids I should not bid again. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot. <EOS>
THOMAS MOWBRAY: <EOS>
Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot. <EOS>
My life thou shalt command, but not my shame: <EOS>
The one my duty owes; but my fair name, <EOS>
Despite of death that lives upon my grave, <EOS>
To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have. <EOS>
I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here, <EOS>
Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear, <EOS>
The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood <EOS>
Which breathed this poison. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Rage must be withstood: <EOS>
Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame. <EOS>
THOMAS MOWBRAY: <EOS>
Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame. <EOS>
And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord, <EOS>
The purest treasure mortal times afford <EOS>
Is spotless reputation: that away, <EOS>
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay. <EOS>
A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest <EOS>
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast. <EOS>
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one: <EOS>
Take honour from me, and my life is done: <EOS>
Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try; <EOS>
In that I live and for that will I die. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
O, God defend my soul from such deep sin! <EOS>
Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight? <EOS>
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height <EOS>
Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue <EOS>
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong, <EOS>
Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear <EOS>
The slavish motive of recanting fear, <EOS>
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace, <EOS>
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
We were not born to sue, but to command; <EOS>
Which since we cannot do to make you friends, <EOS>
Be ready, as your lives shall answer it, <EOS>
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day: <EOS>
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate <EOS>
The swelling difference of your settled hate: <EOS>
Since we can not atone you, we shall see <EOS>
Justice design the victor's chivalry. <EOS>
Lord marshal, command our officers at arms <EOS>
Be ready to direct these home alarms. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood <EOS>
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims, <EOS>
To stir against the butchers of his life! <EOS>
But since correction lieth in those hands <EOS>
Which made the fault that we cannot correct, <EOS>
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven; <EOS>
Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth, <EOS>
Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads. <EOS>
DUCHESS: <EOS>
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur? <EOS>
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire? <EOS>
Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one, <EOS>
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood, <EOS>
Or seven fair branches springing from one root: <EOS>
Some of those seven are dried by nature's course, <EOS>
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut; <EOS>
But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester, <EOS>
One vial full of Edward's sacred blood, <EOS>
One flourishing branch of his most royal root, <EOS>
Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt, <EOS>
Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded, <EOS>
By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe. <EOS>
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb, <EOS>
That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee <EOS>
Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest, <EOS>
Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent <EOS>
In some large measure to thy father's death, <EOS>
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die, <EOS>
Who was the model of thy father's life. <EOS>
Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair: <EOS>
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd, <EOS>
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life, <EOS>
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee: <EOS>
That which in mean men we intitle patience <EOS>
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts. <EOS>
What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life, <EOS>
The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute, <EOS>
His deputy anointed in His sight, <EOS>
Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully, <EOS>
Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift <EOS>
An angry arm against His minister. <EOS>
DUCHESS: <EOS>
Where then, alas, may I complain myself? <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
To God, the widow's champion and defence. <EOS>
DUCHESS: <EOS>
Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt. <EOS>
Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold <EOS>
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight: <EOS>
O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear, <EOS>
That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast! <EOS>
Or, if misfortune miss the first career, <EOS>
Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom, <EOS>
They may break his foaming courser's back, <EOS>
And throw the rider headlong in the lists, <EOS>
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford! <EOS>
Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife <EOS>
With her companion grief must end her life. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry: <EOS>
As much good stay with thee as go with me! <EOS>
DUCHESS: <EOS>
Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls, <EOS>
Not with the empty hollowness, but weight: <EOS>
I take my leave before I have begun, <EOS>
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done. <EOS>
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York. <EOS>
Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so; <EOS>
Though this be all, do not so quickly go; <EOS>
I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?-- <EOS>
With all good speed at Plashy visit me. <EOS>
Alack, and what shall good old York there see <EOS>
But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls, <EOS>
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones? <EOS>
And what hear there for welcome but my groans? <EOS>
Therefore commend me; let him not come there, <EOS>
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where. <EOS>
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die: <EOS>
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye. <EOS>
Lord Marshal: <EOS>
My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd? <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in. <EOS>
Lord Marshal: <EOS>
The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold, <EOS>
Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay <EOS>
For nothing but his majesty's approach. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Marshal, demand of yonder champion <EOS>
The cause of his arrival here in arms: <EOS>
Ask him his name and orderly proceed <EOS>
To swear him in the justice of his cause. <EOS>
Lord Marshal: <EOS>
In God's name and the king's, say who thou art <EOS>
And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms, <EOS>
Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel: <EOS>
Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath; <EOS>
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour! <EOS>
THOMAS MOWBRAY: <EOS>
My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk; <EOS>
Who hither come engaged by my oath-- <EOS>
Which God defend a knight should violate!-- <EOS>
Both to defend my loyalty and truth <EOS>
To God, my king and my succeeding issue, <EOS>
Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me <EOS>
And, by the grace of God and this mine arm, <EOS>
To prove him, in defending of myself, <EOS>
A traitor to my God, my king, and me: <EOS>
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven! <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms, <EOS>
Both who he is and why he cometh hither <EOS>
Thus plated in habiliments of war, <EOS>
And formally, according to our law, <EOS>
Depose him in the justice of his cause. <EOS>
Lord Marshal: <EOS>
What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither, <EOS>
Before King Richard in his royal lists? <EOS>
Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel? <EOS>
Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven! <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby <EOS>
Am I; who ready here do stand in arms, <EOS>
To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour, <EOS>
In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, <EOS>
That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous, <EOS>
To God of heaven, King Richard and to me; <EOS>
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven! <EOS>
Lord Marshal: <EOS>
On pain of death, no person be so bold <EOS>
Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists, <EOS>
Except the marshal and such officers <EOS>
Appointed to direct these fair designs. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand, <EOS>
And bow my knee before his majesty: <EOS>
For Mowbray and myself are like two men <EOS>
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage; <EOS>
Then let us take a ceremonious leave <EOS>
And loving farewell of our several friends. <EOS>
Lord Marshal: <EOS>
The appellant in all duty greets your highness, <EOS>
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
We will descend and fold him in our arms. <EOS>
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right, <EOS>
So be thy fortune in this royal fight! <EOS>
Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed, <EOS>
Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
O let no noble eye profane a tear <EOS>
For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear: <EOS>
As confident as is the falcon's flight <EOS>
Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight. <EOS>
My loving lord, I take my leave of you; <EOS>
Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle; <EOS>
Not sick, although I have to do with death, <EOS>
But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath. <EOS>
Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet <EOS>
The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet: <EOS>
O thou, the earthly author of my blood, <EOS>
Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate, <EOS>
Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up <EOS>
To reach at victory above my head, <EOS>
Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers; <EOS>
And with thy blessings steel my lance's point, <EOS>
That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat, <EOS>
And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt, <EOS>
Even in the lusty havior of his son. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
God in thy good cause make thee prosperous! <EOS>
Be swift like lightning in the execution; <EOS>
And let thy blows, doubly redoubled, <EOS>
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque <EOS>
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy: <EOS>
Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive! <EOS>
THOMAS MOWBRAY: <EOS>
However God or fortune cast my lot, <EOS>
There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne, <EOS>
A loyal, just and upright gentleman: <EOS>
Never did captive with a freer heart <EOS>
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace <EOS>
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement, <EOS>
More than my dancing soul doth celebrate <EOS>
This feast of battle with mine adversary. <EOS>
Most mighty liege, and my companion peers, <EOS>
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years: <EOS>
As gentle and as jocund as to jest <EOS>
Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Farewell, my lord: securely I espy <EOS>
Virtue with valour couched in thine eye. <EOS>
Order the trial, marshal, and begin. <EOS>
Lord Marshal: <EOS>
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby, <EOS>
Receive thy lance; and God defend the right! <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen. <EOS>
Lord Marshal: <EOS>
Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk. <EOS>
First Herald: <EOS>
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby, <EOS>
Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself, <EOS>
On pain to be found false and recreant, <EOS>
To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray, <EOS>
A traitor to his God, his king and him; <EOS>
And dares him to set forward to the fight. <EOS>
Second Herald: <EOS>
Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, <EOS>
On pain to be found false and recreant, <EOS>
Both to defend himself and to approve <EOS>
Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby, <EOS>
To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal; <EOS>
Courageously and with a free desire <EOS>
Attending but the signal to begin. <EOS>
Lord Marshal: <EOS>
Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants. <EOS>
Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Let them lay by their helmets and their spears, <EOS>
And both return back to their chairs again: <EOS>
Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound <EOS>
While we return these dukes what we decree. <EOS>
Draw near, <EOS>
And list what with our council we have done. <EOS>
For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd <EOS>
With that dear blood which it hath fostered; <EOS>
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect <EOS>
Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword; <EOS>
And for we think the eagle-winged pride <EOS>
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts, <EOS>
With rival-hating envy, set on you <EOS>
To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle <EOS>
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep; <EOS>
Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums, <EOS>
With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray, <EOS>
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms, <EOS>
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace <EOS>
And make us wade even in our kindred's blood, <EOS>
Therefore, we banish you our territories: <EOS>
You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life, <EOS>
Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields <EOS>
Shall not regreet our fair dominions, <EOS>
But tread the stranger paths of banishment. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Your will be done: this must my comfort be, <EOS>
Sun that warms you here shall shine on me; <EOS>
And those his golden beams to you here lent <EOS>
Shall point on me and gild my banishment. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom, <EOS>
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce: <EOS>
The sly slow hours shall not determinate <EOS>
The dateless limit of thy dear exile; <EOS>
The hopeless word of 'never to return' <EOS>
Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life. <EOS>
THOMAS MOWBRAY: <EOS>
A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege, <EOS>
And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth: <EOS>
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim <EOS>
As to be cast forth in the common air, <EOS>
Have I deserved at your highness' hands. <EOS>
The language I have learn'd these forty years, <EOS>
My native English, now I must forego: <EOS>
And now my tongue's use is to me no more <EOS>
Than an unstringed viol or a harp, <EOS>
Or like a cunning instrument cased up, <EOS>
Or, being open, put into his hands <EOS>
That knows no touch to tune the harmony: <EOS>
Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue, <EOS>
Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips; <EOS>
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance <EOS>
Is made my gaoler to attend on me. <EOS>
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse, <EOS>
Too far in years to be a pupil now: <EOS>
What is thy sentence then but speechless death, <EOS>
Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath? <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
It boots thee not to be compassionate: <EOS>
After our sentence plaining comes too late. <EOS>
THOMAS MOWBRAY: <EOS>
Then thus I turn me from my country's light, <EOS>
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Return again, and take an oath with thee. <EOS>
Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands; <EOS>
Swear by the duty that you owe to God-- <EOS>
Our part therein we banish with yourselves-- <EOS>
To keep the oath that we administer: <EOS>
You never shall, so help you truth and God! <EOS>
Embrace each other's love in banishment; <EOS>
Nor never look upon each other's face; <EOS>
Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile <EOS>
This louring tempest of your home-bred hate; <EOS>
Nor never by advised purpose meet <EOS>
To plot, contrive, or complot any ill <EOS>
'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
I swear. <EOS>
THOMAS MOWBRAY: <EOS>
And I, to keep all this. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:-- <EOS>
By this time, had the king permitted us, <EOS>
One of our souls had wander'd in the air. <EOS>
Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh, <EOS>
As now our flesh is banish'd from this land: <EOS>
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm; <EOS>
Since thou hast far to go, bear not along <EOS>
The clogging burthen of a guilty soul. <EOS>
THOMAS MOWBRAY: <EOS>
No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor, <EOS>
My name be blotted from the book of life, <EOS>
And I from heaven banish'd as from hence! <EOS>
But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know; <EOS>
And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue. <EOS>
Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray; <EOS>
Save back to England, all the world's my way. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes <EOS>
I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect <EOS>
Hath from the number of his banish'd years <EOS>
Pluck'd four away. <EOS>
Six frozen winter spent, <EOS>
Return with welcome home from banishment. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
How long a time lies in one little word! <EOS>
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs <EOS>
End in a word: such is the breath of kings. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
I thank my liege, that in regard of me <EOS>
He shortens four years of my son's exile: <EOS>
But little vantage shall I reap thereby; <EOS>
For, ere the six years that he hath to spend <EOS>
Can change their moons and bring their times about <EOS>
My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light <EOS>
Shall be extinct with age and endless night; <EOS>
My inch of taper will be burnt and done, <EOS>
And blindfold death not let me see my son. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Why uncle, thou hast many years to live. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
But not a minute, king, that thou canst give: <EOS>
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow, <EOS>
And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow; <EOS>
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age, <EOS>
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage; <EOS>
Thy word is current with him for my death, <EOS>
But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Thy son is banish'd upon good advice, <EOS>
Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave: <EOS>
Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour? <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour. <EOS>
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather <EOS>
You would have bid me argue like a father. <EOS>
O, had it been a stranger, not my child, <EOS>
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild: <EOS>
A partial slander sought I to avoid, <EOS>
And in the sentence my own life destroy'd. <EOS>
Alas, I look'd when some of you should say, <EOS>
I was too strict to make mine own away; <EOS>
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue <EOS>
Against my will to do myself this wrong. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so: <EOS>
Six years we banish him, and he shall go. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know, <EOS>
From where you do remain let paper show. <EOS>
Lord Marshal: <EOS>
My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride, <EOS>
As far as land will let me, by your side. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words, <EOS>
That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends? <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
I have too few to take my leave of you, <EOS>
When the tongue's office should be prodigal <EOS>
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Joy absent, grief is present for that time. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
What is six winters? they are quickly gone. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so, <EOS>
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
The sullen passage of thy weary steps <EOS>
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set <EOS>
The precious jewel of thy home return. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make <EOS>
Will but remember me what a deal of world <EOS>
I wander from the jewels that I love. <EOS>
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood <EOS>
To foreign passages, and in the end, <EOS>
Having my freedom, boast of nothing else <EOS>
But that I was a journeyman to grief? <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
All places that the eye of heaven visits <EOS>
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens. <EOS>
Teach thy necessity to reason thus; <EOS>
There is no virtue like necessity. <EOS>
Think not the king did banish thee, <EOS>
But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit, <EOS>
Where it perceives it is but faintly borne. <EOS>
Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour <EOS>
And not the king exiled thee; or suppose <EOS>
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air <EOS>
And thou art flying to a fresher clime: <EOS>
Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it <EOS>
To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest: <EOS>
Suppose the singing birds musicians, <EOS>
The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd, <EOS>
The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more <EOS>
Than a delightful measure or a dance; <EOS>
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite <EOS>
The man that mocks at it and sets it light. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
O, who can hold a fire in his hand <EOS>
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus? <EOS>
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite <EOS>
By bare imagination of a feast? <EOS>
Or wallow naked in December snow <EOS>
By thinking on fantastic summer's heat? <EOS>
O, no! the apprehension of the good <EOS>
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse: <EOS>
Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more <EOS>
Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way: <EOS>
Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu; <EOS>
My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet! <EOS>
Where'er I wander, boast of this I can, <EOS>
Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
We did observe. Cousin Aumerle, <EOS>
How far brought you high Hereford on his way? <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
I brought high Hereford, if you call him so, <EOS>
But to the next highway, and there I left him. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
And say, what store of parting tears were shed? <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind, <EOS>
Which then blew bitterly against our faces, <EOS>
Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance <EOS>
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
What said our cousin when you parted with him? <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
'Farewell:' <EOS>
And, for my heart disdained that my tongue <EOS>
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft <EOS>
To counterfeit oppression of such grief <EOS>
That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave. <EOS>
Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours <EOS>
And added years to his short banishment, <EOS>
He should have had a volume of farewells; <EOS>
But since it would not, he had none of me. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt, <EOS>
When time shall call him home from banishment, <EOS>
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends. <EOS>
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green <EOS>
Observed his courtship to the common people; <EOS>
How he did seem to dive into their hearts <EOS>
With humble and familiar courtesy, <EOS>
What reverence he did throw away on slaves, <EOS>
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles <EOS>
And patient underbearing of his fortune, <EOS>
As 'twere to banish their affects with him. <EOS>
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench; <EOS>
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well <EOS>
And had the tribute of his supple knee, <EOS>
With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;' <EOS>
As were our England in reversion his, <EOS>
And he our subjects' next degree in hope. <EOS>
GREEN: <EOS>
Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts. <EOS>
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland, <EOS>
Expedient manage must be made, my liege, <EOS>
Ere further leisure yield them further means <EOS>
For their advantage and your highness' loss. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
We will ourself in person to this war: <EOS>
And, for our coffers, with too great a court <EOS>
And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light, <EOS>
We are inforced to farm our royal realm; <EOS>
The revenue whereof shall furnish us <EOS>
For our affairs in hand: if that come short, <EOS>
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters; <EOS>
Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich, <EOS>
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold <EOS>
And send them after to supply our wants; <EOS>
For we will make for Ireland presently. <EOS>
Bushy, what news? <EOS>
BUSHY: <EOS>
Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord, <EOS>
Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste <EOS>
To entreat your majesty to visit him. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Where lies he? <EOS>
BUSHY: <EOS>
At Ely House. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Now put it, God, in the physician's mind <EOS>
To help him to his grave immediately! <EOS>
The lining of his coffers shall make coats <EOS>
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars. <EOS>
Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him: <EOS>
Pray God we may make haste, and come too late! <EOS>
All: <EOS>
Amen. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
Will the king come, that I may breathe my last <EOS>
In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth? <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath; <EOS>
For all in vain comes counsel to his ear. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
O, but they say the tongues of dying men <EOS>
Enforce attention like deep harmony: <EOS>
Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain, <EOS>
For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain. <EOS>
He that no more must say is listen'd more <EOS>
Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose; <EOS>
More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before: <EOS>
The setting sun, and music at the close, <EOS>
As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last, <EOS>
Writ in remembrance more than things long past: <EOS>
Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear, <EOS>
My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds, <EOS>
As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond, <EOS>
Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound <EOS>
The open ear of youth doth always listen; <EOS>
Report of fashions in proud Italy, <EOS>
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation <EOS>
Limps after in base imitation. <EOS>
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity-- <EOS>
So it be new, there's no respect how vile-- <EOS>
That is not quickly buzzed into his ears? <EOS>
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard, <EOS>
Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard. <EOS>
Direct not him whose way himself will choose: <EOS>
'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
Methinks I am a prophet new inspired <EOS>
And thus expiring do foretell of him: <EOS>
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last, <EOS>
For violent fires soon burn out themselves; <EOS>
Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short; <EOS>
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes; <EOS>
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder: <EOS>
Light vanity, insatiate cormorant, <EOS>
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself. <EOS>
This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle, <EOS>
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, <EOS>
This other Eden, demi-paradise, <EOS>
This fortress built by Nature for herself <EOS>
Against infection and the hand of war, <EOS>
This happy breed of men, this little world, <EOS>
This precious stone set in the silver sea, <EOS>
Which serves it in the office of a wall, <EOS>
Or as a moat defensive to a house, <EOS>
Against the envy of less happier lands, <EOS>
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England, <EOS>
This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings, <EOS>
Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth, <EOS>
Renowned for their deeds as far from home, <EOS>
For Christian service and true chivalry, <EOS>
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry, <EOS>
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son, <EOS>
This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land, <EOS>
Dear for her reputation through the world, <EOS>
Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it, <EOS>
Like to a tenement or pelting farm: <EOS>
England, bound in with the triumphant sea <EOS>
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege <EOS>
Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame, <EOS>
With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds: <EOS>
That England, that was wont to conquer others, <EOS>
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself. <EOS>
Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life, <EOS>
How happy then were my ensuing death! <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
The king is come: deal mildly with his youth; <EOS>
For young hot colts being raged do rage the more. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster? <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt? <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
O how that name befits my composition! <EOS>
Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old: <EOS>
Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast; <EOS>
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt? <EOS>
For sleeping England long time have I watch'd; <EOS>
Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt: <EOS>
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon, <EOS>
Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks; <EOS>
And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt: <EOS>
Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave, <EOS>
Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Can sick men play so nicely with their names? <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
No, misery makes sport to mock itself: <EOS>
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me, <EOS>
I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Should dying men flatter with those that live? <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
No, no, men living flatter those that die. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
Now He that made me knows I see thee ill; <EOS>
Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill. <EOS>
Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land <EOS>
Wherein thou liest in reputation sick; <EOS>
And thou, too careless patient as thou art, <EOS>
Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure <EOS>
Of those physicians that first wounded thee: <EOS>
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown, <EOS>
Whose compass is no bigger than thy head; <EOS>
And yet, incaged in so small a verge, <EOS>
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land. <EOS>
O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye <EOS>
Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons, <EOS>
From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame, <EOS>
Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd, <EOS>
Which art possess'd now to depose thyself. <EOS>
Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world, <EOS>
It were a shame to let this land by lease; <EOS>
But for thy world enjoying but this land, <EOS>
Is it not more than shame to shame it so? <EOS>
Landlord of England art thou now, not king: <EOS>
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou-- <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
A lunatic lean-witted fool, <EOS>
Presuming on an ague's privilege, <EOS>
Darest with thy frozen admonition <EOS>
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood <EOS>
With fury from his native residence. <EOS>
Now, by my seat's right royal majesty, <EOS>
Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son, <EOS>
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head <EOS>
Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders. <EOS>
JOHN OF GAUNT: <EOS>
O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son, <EOS>
For that I was his father Edward's son; <EOS>
That blood already, like the pelican, <EOS>
Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused: <EOS>
My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul, <EOS>
Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls! <EOS>
May be a precedent and witness good <EOS>
That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood: <EOS>
Join with the present sickness that I have; <EOS>
And thy unkindness be like crooked age, <EOS>
To crop at once a too long wither'd flower. <EOS>
Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee! <EOS>
These words hereafter thy tormentors be! <EOS>
Convey me to my bed, then to my grave: <EOS>
Love they to live that love and honour have. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
And let them die that age and sullens have; <EOS>
For both hast thou, and both become the grave. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
I do beseech your majesty, impute his words <EOS>
To wayward sickliness and age in him: <EOS>
He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear <EOS>
As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his; <EOS>
As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
What says he? <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Nay, nothing; all is said <EOS>
His tongue is now a stringless instrument; <EOS>
Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so! <EOS>
Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he; <EOS>
His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be. <EOS>
So much for that. Now for our Irish wars: <EOS>
We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns, <EOS>
Which live like venom where no venom else <EOS>
But only they have privilege to live. <EOS>
And for these great affairs do ask some charge, <EOS>
Towards our assistance we do seize to us <EOS>
The plate, corn, revenues and moveables, <EOS>
Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
How long shall I be patient? ah, how long <EOS>
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong? <EOS>
Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment <EOS>
Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs, <EOS>
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke <EOS>
About his marriage, nor my own disgrace, <EOS>
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek, <EOS>
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face. <EOS>
I am the last of noble Edward's sons, <EOS>
Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first: <EOS>
In war was never lion raged more fierce, <EOS>
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild, <EOS>
Than was that young and princely gentleman. <EOS>
His face thou hast, for even so look'd he, <EOS>
Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours; <EOS>
But when he frown'd, it was against the French <EOS>
And not against his friends; his noble hand <EOS>
Did will what he did spend and spent not that <EOS>
Which his triumphant father's hand had won; <EOS>
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood, <EOS>
But bloody with the enemies of his kin. <EOS>
O Richard! York is too far gone with grief, <EOS>
Or else he never would compare between. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Why, uncle, what's the matter? <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
O my liege, <EOS>
Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased <EOS>
Not to be pardon'd, am content withal. <EOS>
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands <EOS>
The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford? <EOS>
Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live? <EOS>
Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true? <EOS>
Did not the one deserve to have an heir? <EOS>
Is not his heir a well-deserving son? <EOS>
Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time <EOS>
His charters and his customary rights; <EOS>
Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day; <EOS>
Be not thyself; for how art thou a king <EOS>
But by fair sequence and succession? <EOS>
Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!-- <EOS>
If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights, <EOS>
Call in the letters patent that he hath <EOS>
By his attorneys-general to sue <EOS>
His livery, and deny his offer'd homage, <EOS>
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head, <EOS>
You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts <EOS>
And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts <EOS>
Which honour and allegiance cannot think. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Think what you will, we seize into our hands <EOS>
His plate, his goods, his money and his lands. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell: <EOS>
What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell; <EOS>
But by bad courses may be understood <EOS>
That their events can never fall out good. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight: <EOS>
Bid him repair to us to Ely House <EOS>
To see this business. To-morrow next <EOS>
We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow: <EOS>
And we create, in absence of ourself, <EOS>
Our uncle York lord governor of England; <EOS>
For he is just and always loved us well. <EOS>
Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part; <EOS>
Be merry, for our time of stay is short <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead. <EOS>
LORD ROSS: <EOS>
And living too; for now his son is duke. <EOS>
LORD WILLOUGHBY: <EOS>
Barely in title, not in revenue. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Richly in both, if justice had her right. <EOS>
LORD ROSS: <EOS>
My heart is great; but it must break with silence, <EOS>
Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more <EOS>
That speaks thy words again to do thee harm! <EOS>
LORD WILLOUGHBY: <EOS>
Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford? <EOS>
If it be so, out with it boldly, man; <EOS>
Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him. <EOS>
LORD ROSS: <EOS>
No good at all that I can do for him; <EOS>
Unless you call it good to pity him, <EOS>
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne <EOS>
In him, a royal prince, and many moe <EOS>
Of noble blood in this declining land. <EOS>
The king is not himself, but basely led <EOS>
By flatterers; and what they will inform, <EOS>
Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all, <EOS>
That will the king severely prosecute <EOS>
'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs. <EOS>
LORD ROSS: <EOS>
The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes, <EOS>
And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined <EOS>
For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts. <EOS>
LORD WILLOUGHBY: <EOS>
And daily new exactions are devised, <EOS>
As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what: <EOS>
But what, o' God's name, doth become of this? <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not, <EOS>
But basely yielded upon compromise <EOS>
That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows: <EOS>
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars. <EOS>
LORD ROSS: <EOS>
The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm. <EOS>
LORD WILLOUGHBY: <EOS>
The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him. <EOS>
LORD ROSS: <EOS>
He hath not money for these Irish wars, <EOS>
His burthenous taxations notwithstanding, <EOS>
But by the robbing of the banish'd duke. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
His noble kinsman: most degenerate king! <EOS>
But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing, <EOS>
Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm; <EOS>
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails, <EOS>
And yet we strike not, but securely perish. <EOS>
LORD ROSS: <EOS>
We see the very wreck that we must suffer; <EOS>
And unavoided is the danger now, <EOS>
For suffering so the causes of our wreck. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death <EOS>
I spy life peering; but I dare not say <EOS>
How near the tidings of our comfort is. <EOS>
LORD WILLOUGHBY: <EOS>
Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours. <EOS>
LORD ROSS: <EOS>
Be confident to speak, Northumberland: <EOS>
We three are but thyself; and, speaking so, <EOS>
Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay <EOS>
In Brittany, received intelligence <EOS>
That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham, <EOS>
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter, <EOS>
His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury, <EOS>
Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston, <EOS>
Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint, <EOS>
All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne <EOS>
With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war, <EOS>
Are making hither with all due expedience <EOS>
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore: <EOS>
Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay <EOS>
The first departing of the king for Ireland. <EOS>
If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke, <EOS>
Imp out our drooping country's broken wing, <EOS>
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown, <EOS>
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt <EOS>
And make high majesty look like itself, <EOS>
Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh; <EOS>
But if you faint, as fearing to do so, <EOS>
Stay and be secret, and myself will go. <EOS>
LORD ROSS: <EOS>
To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear. <EOS>
LORD WILLOUGHBY: <EOS>
Hold out my horse, and I will first be there. <EOS>
BUSHY: <EOS>
Madam, your majesty is too much sad: <EOS>
You promised, when you parted with the king, <EOS>
To lay aside life-harming heaviness <EOS>
And entertain a cheerful disposition. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
To please the king I did; to please myself <EOS>
I cannot do it; yet I know no cause <EOS>
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief, <EOS>
Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest <EOS>
As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks, <EOS>
Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb, <EOS>
Is coming towards me, and my inward soul <EOS>
With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves, <EOS>
More than with parting from my lord the king. <EOS>
BUSHY: <EOS>
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows, <EOS>
Which shows like grief itself, but is not so; <EOS>
For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears, <EOS>
Divides one thing entire to many objects; <EOS>
Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon <EOS>
Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry <EOS>
Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty, <EOS>
Looking awry upon your lord's departure, <EOS>
Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail; <EOS>
Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows <EOS>
Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen, <EOS>
More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen; <EOS>
Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye, <EOS>
Which for things true weeps things imaginary. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
It may be so; but yet my inward soul <EOS>
Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be, <EOS>
I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad <EOS>
As, though on thinking on no thought I think, <EOS>
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink. <EOS>
BUSHY: <EOS>
'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived <EOS>
From some forefather grief; mine is not so, <EOS>
For nothing had begot my something grief; <EOS>
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve: <EOS>
'Tis in reversion that I do possess; <EOS>
But what it is, that is not yet known; what <EOS>
I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot. <EOS>
GREEN: <EOS>
God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen: <EOS>
I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is; <EOS>
For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope: <EOS>
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd? <EOS>
GREEN: <EOS>
That he, our hope, might have retired his power, <EOS>
And driven into despair an enemy's hope, <EOS>
Who strongly hath set footing in this land: <EOS>
The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself, <EOS>
And with uplifted arms is safe arrived <EOS>
At Ravenspurgh. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
Now God in heaven forbid! <EOS>
GREEN: <EOS>
Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse, <EOS>
The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy, <EOS>
The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby, <EOS>
With all their powerful friends, are fled to him. <EOS>
BUSHY: <EOS>
Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland <EOS>
And all the rest revolted faction traitors? <EOS>
GREEN: <EOS>
We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester <EOS>
Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship, <EOS>
And all the household servants fled with him <EOS>
To Bolingbroke. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe, <EOS>
And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir: <EOS>
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy, <EOS>
And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother, <EOS>
Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd. <EOS>
BUSHY: <EOS>
Despair not, madam. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
Who shall hinder me? <EOS>
I will despair, and be at enmity <EOS>
With cozening hope: he is a flatterer, <EOS>
A parasite, a keeper back of death, <EOS>
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life, <EOS>
Which false hope lingers in extremity. <EOS>
GREEN: <EOS>
Here comes the Duke of York. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
With signs of war about his aged neck: <EOS>
O, full of careful business are his looks! <EOS>
Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts: <EOS>
Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth, <EOS>
Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief. <EOS>
Your husband, he is gone to save far off, <EOS>
Whilst others come to make him lose at home: <EOS>
Here am I left to underprop his land, <EOS>
Who, weak with age, cannot support myself: <EOS>
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made; <EOS>
Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
My lord, your son was gone before I came. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
He was? Why, so! go all which way it will! <EOS>
The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold, <EOS>
And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side. <EOS>
Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester; <EOS>
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound: <EOS>
Hold, take my ring. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship, <EOS>
To-day, as I came by, I called there; <EOS>
But I shall grieve you to report the rest. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
What is't, knave? <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
An hour before I came, the duchess died. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
God for his mercy! what a tide of woes <EOS>
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once! <EOS>
I know not what to do: I would to God, <EOS>
So my untruth had not provoked him to it, <EOS>
The king had cut off my head with my brother's. <EOS>
What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland? <EOS>
How shall we do for money for these wars? <EOS>
Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me. <EOS>
Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts <EOS>
And bring away the armour that is there. <EOS>
Gentlemen, will you go muster men? <EOS>
If I know how or which way to order these affairs <EOS>
Thus thrust disorderly into my hands, <EOS>
Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen: <EOS>
The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath <EOS>
And duty bids defend; the other again <EOS>
Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd, <EOS>
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right. <EOS>
Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll <EOS>
Dispose of you. <EOS>
Gentlemen, go, muster up your men, <EOS>
And meet me presently at Berkeley. <EOS>
I should to Plashy too; <EOS>
But time will not permit: all is uneven, <EOS>
And every thing is left at six and seven. <EOS>
BUSHY: <EOS>
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland, <EOS>
But none returns. For us to levy power <EOS>
Proportionable to the enemy <EOS>
Is all unpossible. <EOS>
GREEN: <EOS>
Besides, our nearness to the king in love <EOS>
Is near the hate of those love not the king. <EOS>
BAGOT: <EOS>
And that's the wavering commons: for their love <EOS>
Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them <EOS>
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate. <EOS>
BUSHY: <EOS>
Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd. <EOS>
BAGOT: <EOS>
If judgement lie in them, then so do we, <EOS>
Because we ever have been near the king. <EOS>
GREEN: <EOS>
Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle: <EOS>
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there. <EOS>
BUSHY: <EOS>
Thither will I with you; for little office <EOS>
The hateful commons will perform for us, <EOS>
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces. <EOS>
Will you go along with us? <EOS>
BAGOT: <EOS>
No; I will to Ireland to his majesty. <EOS>
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain, <EOS>
We three here art that ne'er shall meet again. <EOS>
BUSHY: <EOS>
That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke. <EOS>
GREEN: <EOS>
Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes <EOS>
Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry: <EOS>
Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly. <EOS>
Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever. <EOS>
BUSHY: <EOS>
Well, we may meet again. <EOS>
BAGOT: <EOS>
I fear me, never. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now? <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Believe me, noble lord, <EOS>
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire: <EOS>
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways <EOS>
Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome, <EOS>
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar, <EOS>
Making the hard way sweet and delectable. <EOS>
But I bethink me what a weary way <EOS>
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found <EOS>
In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company, <EOS>
Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled <EOS>
The tediousness and process of my travel: <EOS>
But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have <EOS>
The present benefit which I possess; <EOS>
And hope to joy is little less in joy <EOS>
Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords <EOS>
Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done <EOS>
By sight of what I have, your noble company. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Of much less value is my company <EOS>
Than your good words. But who comes here? <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
It is my son, young Harry Percy, <EOS>
Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever. <EOS>
Harry, how fares your uncle? <EOS>
HENRY PERCY: <EOS>
I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Why, is he not with the queen? <EOS>
HENRY PERCY: <EOS>
No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court, <EOS>
Broken his staff of office and dispersed <EOS>
The household of the king. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
What was his reason? <EOS>
He was not so resolved when last we spake together. <EOS>
HENRY PERCY: <EOS>
Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor. <EOS>
But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh, <EOS>
To offer service to the Duke of Hereford, <EOS>
And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover <EOS>
What power the Duke of York had levied there; <EOS>
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy? <EOS>
HENRY PERCY: <EOS>
No, my good lord, for that is not forgot <EOS>
Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge, <EOS>
I never in my life did look on him. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Then learn to know him now; this is the duke. <EOS>
HENRY PERCY: <EOS>
My gracious lord, I tender you my service, <EOS>
Such as it is, being tender, raw and young: <EOS>
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm <EOS>
To more approved service and desert. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure <EOS>
I count myself in nothing else so happy <EOS>
As in a soul remembering my good friends; <EOS>
And, as my fortune ripens with thy love, <EOS>
It shall be still thy true love's recompense: <EOS>
My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir <EOS>
Keeps good old York there with his men of war? <EOS>
HENRY PERCY: <EOS>
There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees, <EOS>
Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard; <EOS>
And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour; <EOS>
None else of name and noble estimate. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby, <EOS>
Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues <EOS>
A banish'd traitor: all my treasury <EOS>
Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd <EOS>
Shall be your love and labour's recompense. <EOS>
LORD ROSS: <EOS>
Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord. <EOS>
LORD WILLOUGHBY: <EOS>
And far surmounts our labour to attain it. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor; <EOS>
Which, till my infant fortune comes to years, <EOS>
Stands for my bounty. But who comes here? <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess. <EOS>
LORD BERKELEY: <EOS>
My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster; <EOS>
And I am come to seek that name in England; <EOS>
And I must find that title in your tongue, <EOS>
Before I make reply to aught you say. <EOS>
LORD BERKELEY: <EOS>
Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning <EOS>
To raze one title of your honour out: <EOS>
To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will, <EOS>
From the most gracious regent of this land, <EOS>
The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on <EOS>
To take advantage of the absent time <EOS>
And fright our native peace with self-born arms. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
I shall not need transport my words by you; <EOS>
Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle! <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee, <EOS>
Whose duty is deceiveable and false. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
My gracious uncle-- <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Tut, tut! <EOS>
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle: <EOS>
I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.' <EOS>
In an ungracious mouth is but profane. <EOS>
Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs <EOS>
Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground? <EOS>
But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march <EOS>
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom, <EOS>
Frighting her pale-faced villages with war <EOS>
And ostentation of despised arms? <EOS>
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence? <EOS>
Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind, <EOS>
And in my loyal bosom lies his power. <EOS>
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth <EOS>
As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself <EOS>
Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men, <EOS>
From forth the ranks of many thousand French, <EOS>
O, then how quickly should this arm of mine. <EOS>
Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee <EOS>
And minister correction to thy fault! <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
My gracious uncle, let me know my fault: <EOS>
On what condition stands it and wherein? <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Even in condition of the worst degree, <EOS>
In gross rebellion and detested treason: <EOS>
Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come <EOS>
Before the expiration of thy time, <EOS>
In braving arms against thy sovereign. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford; <EOS>
But as I come, I come for Lancaster. <EOS>
And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace <EOS>
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye: <EOS>
You are my father, for methinks in you <EOS>
I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father, <EOS>
Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd <EOS>
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties <EOS>
Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away <EOS>
To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born? <EOS>
If that my cousin king be King of England, <EOS>
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster. <EOS>
You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin; <EOS>
Had you first died, and he been thus trod down, <EOS>
He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father, <EOS>
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay. <EOS>
I am denied to sue my livery here, <EOS>
And yet my letters-patents give me leave: <EOS>
My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold, <EOS>
And these and all are all amiss employ'd. <EOS>
What would you have me do? I am a subject, <EOS>
And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me; <EOS>
And therefore, personally I lay my claim <EOS>
To my inheritance of free descent. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
The noble duke hath been too much abused. <EOS>
LORD ROSS: <EOS>
It stands your grace upon to do him right. <EOS>
LORD WILLOUGHBY: <EOS>
Base men by his endowments are made great. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
My lords of England, let me tell you this: <EOS>
I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs <EOS>
And laboured all I could to do him right; <EOS>
But in this kind to come, in braving arms, <EOS>
Be his own carver and cut out his way, <EOS>
To find out right with wrong, it may not be; <EOS>
And you that do abet him in this kind <EOS>
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
The noble duke hath sworn his coming is <EOS>
But for his own; and for the right of that <EOS>
We all have strongly sworn to give him aid; <EOS>
And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath! <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Well, well, I see the issue of these arms: <EOS>
I cannot mend it, I must needs confess, <EOS>
Because my power is weak and all ill left: <EOS>
But if I could, by Him that gave me life, <EOS>
I would attach you all and make you stoop <EOS>
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king; <EOS>
But since I cannot, be it known to you <EOS>
I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well; <EOS>
Unless you please to enter in the castle <EOS>
And there repose you for this night. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
An offer, uncle, that we will accept: <EOS>
But we must win your grace to go with us <EOS>
To Bristol castle, which they say is held <EOS>
By Bushy, Bagot and their complices, <EOS>
The caterpillars of the commonwealth, <EOS>
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause; <EOS>
For I am loath to break our country's laws. <EOS>
Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are: <EOS>
Things past redress are now with me past care. <EOS>
Captain: <EOS>
My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days, <EOS>
And hardly kept our countrymen together, <EOS>
And yet we hear no tidings from the king; <EOS>
Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell. <EOS>
EARL OF SALISBURY: <EOS>
Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman: <EOS>
The king reposeth all his confidence in thee. <EOS>
Captain: <EOS>
'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay. <EOS>
The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd <EOS>
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven; <EOS>
The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth <EOS>
And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change; <EOS>
Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap, <EOS>
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy, <EOS>
The other to enjoy by rage and war: <EOS>
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings. <EOS>
Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled, <EOS>
As well assured Richard their king is dead. <EOS>
EARL OF SALISBURY: <EOS>
Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind <EOS>
I see thy glory like a shooting star <EOS>
Fall to the base earth from the firmament. <EOS>
Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west, <EOS>
Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest: <EOS>
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes, <EOS>
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Bring forth these men. <EOS>
Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls-- <EOS>
Since presently your souls must part your bodies-- <EOS>
With too much urging your pernicious lives, <EOS>
For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood <EOS>
From off my hands, here in the view of men <EOS>
I will unfold some causes of your deaths. <EOS>
You have misled a prince, a royal king, <EOS>
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments, <EOS>
By you unhappied and disfigured clean: <EOS>
You have in manner with your sinful hours <EOS>
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him, <EOS>
Broke the possession of a royal bed <EOS>
And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks <EOS>
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs. <EOS>
Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth, <EOS>
Near to the king in blood, and near in love <EOS>
Till you did make him misinterpret me, <EOS>
Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries, <EOS>
And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds, <EOS>
Eating the bitter bread of banishment; <EOS>
Whilst you have fed upon my signories, <EOS>
Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods, <EOS>
From my own windows torn my household coat, <EOS>
Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign, <EOS>
Save men's opinions and my living blood, <EOS>
To show the world I am a gentleman. <EOS>
This and much more, much more than twice all this, <EOS>
Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over <EOS>
To execution and the hand of death. <EOS>
BUSHY: <EOS>
More welcome is the stroke of death to me <EOS>
Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell. <EOS>
GREEN: <EOS>
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls <EOS>
And plague injustice with the pains of hell. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd. <EOS>
Uncle, you say the queen is at your house; <EOS>
For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated: <EOS>
Tell her I send to her my kind commends; <EOS>
Take special care my greetings be deliver'd. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd <EOS>
With letters of your love to her at large. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away. <EOS>
To fight with Glendower and his complices: <EOS>
Awhile to work, and after holiday. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Barkloughly castle call they this at hand? <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air, <EOS>
After your late tossing on the breaking seas? <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy <EOS>
To stand upon my kingdom once again. <EOS>
Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand, <EOS>
Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs: <EOS>
As a long-parted mother with her child <EOS>
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting, <EOS>
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth, <EOS>
And do thee favours with my royal hands. <EOS>
Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth, <EOS>
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense; <EOS>
But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom, <EOS>
And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way, <EOS>
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet <EOS>
Which with usurping steps do trample thee: <EOS>
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies; <EOS>
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower, <EOS>
Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder <EOS>
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch <EOS>
Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies. <EOS>
Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords: <EOS>
This earth shall have a feeling and these stones <EOS>
Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king <EOS>
Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms. <EOS>
BISHOP OF CARLISLE: <EOS>
Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king <EOS>
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all. <EOS>
The means that heaven yields must be embraced, <EOS>
And not neglected; else, if heaven would, <EOS>
And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse, <EOS>
The proffer'd means of succor and redress. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
He means, my lord, that we are too remiss; <EOS>
Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security, <EOS>
Grows strong and great in substance and in power. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not <EOS>
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid, <EOS>
Behind the globe, that lights the lower world, <EOS>
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen <EOS>
In murders and in outrage, boldly here; <EOS>
But when from under this terrestrial ball <EOS>
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines <EOS>
And darts his light through every guilty hole, <EOS>
Then murders, treasons and detested sins, <EOS>
The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs, <EOS>
Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves? <EOS>
So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke, <EOS>
Who all this while hath revell'd in the night <EOS>
Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes, <EOS>
Shall see us rising in our throne, the east, <EOS>
His treasons will sit blushing in his face, <EOS>
Not able to endure the sight of day, <EOS>
But self-affrighted tremble at his sin. <EOS>
Not all the water in the rough rude sea <EOS>
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king; <EOS>
The breath of worldly men cannot depose <EOS>
The deputy elected by the Lord: <EOS>
For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd <EOS>
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown, <EOS>
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay <EOS>
A glorious angel: then, if angels fight, <EOS>
Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right. <EOS>
Welcome, my lord how far off lies your power? <EOS>
EARL OF SALISBURY: <EOS>
Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord, <EOS>
Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue <EOS>
And bids me speak of nothing but despair. <EOS>
One day too late, I fear me, noble lord, <EOS>
Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth: <EOS>
O, call back yesterday, bid time return, <EOS>
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men! <EOS>
To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late, <EOS>
O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state: <EOS>
For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead. <EOS>
Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale? <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
But now the blood of twenty thousand men <EOS>
Did triumph in my face, and they are fled; <EOS>
And, till so much blood thither come again, <EOS>
Have I not reason to look pale and dead? <EOS>
All souls that will be safe fly from my side, <EOS>
For time hath set a blot upon my pride. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Comfort, my liege; remember who you are. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
I had forgot myself; am I not king? <EOS>
Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest. <EOS>
Is not the king's name twenty thousand names? <EOS>
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes <EOS>
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground, <EOS>
Ye favourites of a king: are we not high? <EOS>
High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York <EOS>
Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here? <EOS>
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: <EOS>
More health and happiness betide my liege <EOS>
Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him! <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Mine ear is open and my heart prepared; <EOS>
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold. <EOS>
Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care <EOS>
And what loss is it to be rid of care? <EOS>
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we? <EOS>
Greater he shall not be; if he serve God, <EOS>
We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so: <EOS>
Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend; <EOS>
They break their faith to God as well as us: <EOS>
Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay: <EOS>
The worst is death, and death will have his day. <EOS>
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: <EOS>
Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd <EOS>
To bear the tidings of calamity. <EOS>
Like an unseasonable stormy day, <EOS>
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores, <EOS>
As if the world were all dissolved to tears, <EOS>
So high above his limits swells the rage <EOS>
Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land <EOS>
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel. <EOS>
White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps <EOS>
Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices, <EOS>
Strive to speak big and clap their female joints <EOS>
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown: <EOS>
The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows <EOS>
Of double-fatal yew against thy state; <EOS>
Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills <EOS>
Against thy seat: both young and old rebel, <EOS>
And all goes worse than I have power to tell. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill. <EOS>
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot? <EOS>
What is become of Bushy? where is Green? <EOS>
That they have let the dangerous enemy <EOS>
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps? <EOS>
If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it: <EOS>
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke. <EOS>
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: <EOS>
Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption! <EOS>
Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man! <EOS>
Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart! <EOS>
Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas! <EOS>
Would they make peace? terrible hell make war <EOS>
Upon their spotted souls for this offence! <EOS>
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: <EOS>
Sweet love, I see, changing his property, <EOS>
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate: <EOS>
Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made <EOS>
With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse <EOS>
Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound <EOS>
And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead? <EOS>
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: <EOS>
Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Where is the duke my father with his power? <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
No matter where; of comfort no man speak: <EOS>
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs; <EOS>
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes <EOS>
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth, <EOS>
Let's choose executors and talk of wills: <EOS>
And yet not so, for what can we bequeath <EOS>
Save our deposed bodies to the ground? <EOS>
Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's, <EOS>
And nothing can we call our own but death <EOS>
And that small model of the barren earth <EOS>
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones. <EOS>
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground <EOS>
And tell sad stories of the death of kings; <EOS>
How some have been deposed; some slain in war, <EOS>
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed; <EOS>
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd; <EOS>
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown <EOS>
That rounds the mortal temples of a king <EOS>
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits, <EOS>
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp, <EOS>
Allowing him a breath, a little scene, <EOS>
To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks, <EOS>
Infusing him with self and vain conceit, <EOS>
As if this flesh which walls about our life, <EOS>
Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus <EOS>
Comes at the last and with a little pin <EOS>
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king! <EOS>
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood <EOS>
With solemn reverence: throw away respect, <EOS>
Tradition, form and ceremonious duty, <EOS>
For you have but mistook me all this while: <EOS>
I live with bread like you, feel want, <EOS>
Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus, <EOS>
How can you say to me, I am a king? <EOS>
BISHOP OF CARLISLE: <EOS>
My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes, <EOS>
But presently prevent the ways to wail. <EOS>
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength, <EOS>
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe, <EOS>
And so your follies fight against yourself. <EOS>
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight: <EOS>
And fight and die is death destroying death; <EOS>
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
My father hath a power; inquire of him <EOS>
And learn to make a body of a limb. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come <EOS>
To change blows with thee for our day of doom. <EOS>
This ague fit of fear is over-blown; <EOS>
An easy task it is to win our own. <EOS>
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power? <EOS>
Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour. <EOS>
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: <EOS>
Men judge by the complexion of the sky <EOS>
The state and inclination of the day: <EOS>
So may you by my dull and heavy eye, <EOS>
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say. <EOS>
I play the torturer, by small and small <EOS>
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken: <EOS>
Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke, <EOS>
And all your northern castles yielded up, <EOS>
And all your southern gentlemen in arms <EOS>
Upon his party. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Thou hast said enough. <EOS>
Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth <EOS>
Of that sweet way I was in to despair! <EOS>
What say you now? what comfort have we now? <EOS>
By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly <EOS>
That bids me be of comfort any more. <EOS>
Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away; <EOS>
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey. <EOS>
That power I have, discharge; and let them go <EOS>
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow, <EOS>
For I have none: let no man speak again <EOS>
To alter this, for counsel is but vain. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
My liege, one word. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
He does me double wrong <EOS>
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue. <EOS>
Discharge my followers: let them hence away, <EOS>
From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
So that by this intelligence we learn <EOS>
The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury <EOS>
Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed <EOS>
With some few private friends upon this coast. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
The news is very fair and good, my lord: <EOS>
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland <EOS>
To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day <EOS>
When such a sacred king should hide his head. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Your grace mistakes; only to be brief <EOS>
Left I his title out. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
The time hath been, <EOS>
Would you have been so brief with him, he would <EOS>
Have been so brief with you, to shorten you, <EOS>
For taking so the head, your whole head's length. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Mistake not, uncle, further than you should. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Take not, good cousin, further than you should. <EOS>
Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself <EOS>
Against their will. But who comes here? <EOS>
Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield? <EOS>
HENRY PERCY: <EOS>
The castle royally is mann'd, my lord, <EOS>
Against thy entrance. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Royally! <EOS>
Why, it contains no king? <EOS>
HENRY PERCY: <EOS>
Yes, my good lord, <EOS>
It doth contain a king; King Richard lies <EOS>
Within the limits of yon lime and stone: <EOS>
And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury, <EOS>
Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman <EOS>
Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Noble lords, <EOS>
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle; <EOS>
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley <EOS>
Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver: <EOS>
Henry Bolingbroke <EOS>
On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand <EOS>
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart <EOS>
To his most royal person, hither come <EOS>
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power, <EOS>
Provided that my banishment repeal'd <EOS>
And lands restored again be freely granted: <EOS>
If not, I'll use the advantage of my power <EOS>
And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood <EOS>
Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen: <EOS>
The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke <EOS>
It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench <EOS>
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land, <EOS>
My stooping duty tenderly shall show. <EOS>
Go, signify as much, while here we march <EOS>
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain. <EOS>
Let's march without the noise of threatening drum, <EOS>
That from this castle's tatter'd battlements <EOS>
Our fair appointments may be well perused. <EOS>
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet <EOS>
With no less terror than the elements <EOS>
Of fire and water, when their thundering shock <EOS>
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven. <EOS>
Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water: <EOS>
The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain <EOS>
My waters; on the earth, and not on him. <EOS>
March on, and mark King Richard how he looks. <EOS>
See, see, King Richard doth himself appear, <EOS>
As doth the blushing discontented sun <EOS>
From out the fiery portal of the east, <EOS>
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent <EOS>
To dim his glory and to stain the track <EOS>
Of his bright passage to the occident. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye, <EOS>
As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth <EOS>
Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe, <EOS>
That any harm should stain so fair a show! <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
We are amazed; and thus long have we stood <EOS>
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee, <EOS>
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king: <EOS>
And if we be, how dare thy joints forget <EOS>
To pay their awful duty to our presence? <EOS>
If we be not, show us the hand of God <EOS>
That hath dismissed us from our stewardship; <EOS>
For well we know, no hand of blood and bone <EOS>
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre, <EOS>
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp. <EOS>
And though you think that all, as you have done, <EOS>
Have torn their souls by turning them from us, <EOS>
And we are barren and bereft of friends; <EOS>
Yet know, my master, God omnipotent, <EOS>
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf <EOS>
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike <EOS>
Your children yet unborn and unbegot, <EOS>
That lift your vassal hands against my head <EOS>
And threat the glory of my precious crown. <EOS>
Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands-- <EOS>
That every stride he makes upon my land <EOS>
Is dangerous treason: he is come to open <EOS>
The purple testament of bleeding war; <EOS>
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace, <EOS>
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons <EOS>
Shall ill become the flower of England's face, <EOS>
Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace <EOS>
To scarlet indignation and bedew <EOS>
Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
The king of heaven forbid our lord the king <EOS>
Should so with civil and uncivil arms <EOS>
Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin <EOS>
Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand; <EOS>
And by the honourable tomb he swears, <EOS>
That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones, <EOS>
And by the royalties of both your bloods, <EOS>
Currents that spring from one most gracious head, <EOS>
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt, <EOS>
And by the worth and honour of himself, <EOS>
Comprising all that may be sworn or said, <EOS>
His coming hither hath no further scope <EOS>
Than for his lineal royalties and to beg <EOS>
Enfranchisement immediate on his knees: <EOS>
Which on thy royal party granted once, <EOS>
His glittering arms he will commend to rust, <EOS>
His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart <EOS>
To faithful service of your majesty. <EOS>
This swears he, as he is a prince, is just; <EOS>
And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Northumberland, say thus the king returns: <EOS>
His noble cousin is right welcome hither; <EOS>
And all the number of his fair demands <EOS>
Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction: <EOS>
With all the gracious utterance thou hast <EOS>
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends. <EOS>
We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not, <EOS>
To look so poorly and to speak so fair? <EOS>
Shall we call back Northumberland, and send <EOS>
Defiance to the traitor, and so die? <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words <EOS>
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine, <EOS>
That laid the sentence of dread banishment <EOS>
On yon proud man, should take it off again <EOS>
With words of sooth! O that I were as great <EOS>
As is my grief, or lesser than my name! <EOS>
Or that I could forget what I have been, <EOS>
Or not remember what I must be now! <EOS>
Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat, <EOS>
Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
What must the king do now? must he submit? <EOS>
The king shall do it: must he be deposed? <EOS>
The king shall be contented: must he lose <EOS>
The name of king? o' God's name, let it go: <EOS>
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads, <EOS>
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage, <EOS>
My gay apparel for an almsman's gown, <EOS>
My figured goblets for a dish of wood, <EOS>
My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff, <EOS>
My subjects for a pair of carved saints <EOS>
And my large kingdom for a little grave, <EOS>
A little little grave, an obscure grave; <EOS>
Or I'll be buried in the king's highway, <EOS>
Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet <EOS>
May hourly trample on their sovereign's head; <EOS>
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live; <EOS>
And buried once, why not upon my head? <EOS>
Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin! <EOS>
We'll make foul weather with despised tears; <EOS>
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn, <EOS>
And make a dearth in this revolting land. <EOS>
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes, <EOS>
And make some pretty match with shedding tears? <EOS>
As thus, to drop them still upon one place, <EOS>
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves <EOS>
Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies <EOS>
Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes. <EOS>
Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see <EOS>
I talk but idly, and you laugh at me. <EOS>
Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland, <EOS>
What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty <EOS>
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die? <EOS>
You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
My lord, in the base court he doth attend <EOS>
To speak with you; may it please you to come down. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon, <EOS>
Wanting the manage of unruly jades. <EOS>
In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base, <EOS>
To come at traitors' calls and do them grace. <EOS>
In the base court? Come down? Down, court! <EOS>
down, king! <EOS>
For night-owls shriek where mounting larks <EOS>
should sing. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
What says his majesty? <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Sorrow and grief of heart <EOS>
Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man <EOS>
Yet he is come. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Stand all apart, <EOS>
And show fair duty to his majesty. <EOS>
My gracious lord,-- <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee <EOS>
To make the base earth proud with kissing it: <EOS>
Me rather had my heart might feel your love <EOS>
Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy. <EOS>
Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know, <EOS>
Thus high at least, although your knee be low. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
My gracious lord, I come but for mine own. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
So far be mine, my most redoubted lord, <EOS>
As my true service shall deserve your love. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Well you deserve: they well deserve to have, <EOS>
That know the strong'st and surest way to get. <EOS>
Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes; <EOS>
Tears show their love, but want their remedies. <EOS>
Cousin, I am too young to be your father, <EOS>
Though you are old enough to be my heir. <EOS>
What you will have, I'll give, and willing too; <EOS>
For do we must what force will have us do. <EOS>
Set on towards London, cousin, is it so? <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Yea, my good lord. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Then I must not say no. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
What sport shall we devise here in this garden, <EOS>
To drive away the heavy thought of care? <EOS>
Lady: <EOS>
Madam, we'll play at bowls. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs, <EOS>
And that my fortune rubs against the bias. <EOS>
Lady: <EOS>
Madam, we'll dance. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
My legs can keep no measure in delight, <EOS>
When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief: <EOS>
Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport. <EOS>
Lady: <EOS>
Madam, we'll tell tales. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
Of sorrow or of joy? <EOS>
Lady: <EOS>
Of either, madam. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
Of neither, girl: <EOS>
For of joy, being altogether wanting, <EOS>
It doth remember me the more of sorrow; <EOS>
Or if of grief, being altogether had, <EOS>
It adds more sorrow to my want of joy: <EOS>
For what I have I need not to repeat; <EOS>
And what I want it boots not to complain. <EOS>
Lady: <EOS>
Madam, I'll sing. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
'Tis well that thou hast cause <EOS>
But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep. <EOS>
Lady: <EOS>
I could weep, madam, would it do you good. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
And I could sing, would weeping do me good, <EOS>
And never borrow any tear of thee. <EOS>
But stay, here come the gardeners: <EOS>
Let's step into the shadow of these trees. <EOS>
My wretchedness unto a row of pins, <EOS>
They'll talk of state; for every one doth so <EOS>
Against a change; woe is forerun with woe. <EOS>
Gardener: <EOS>
Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks, <EOS>
Which, like unruly children, make their sire <EOS>
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight: <EOS>
Give some supportance to the bending twigs. <EOS>
Go thou, and like an executioner, <EOS>
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays, <EOS>
That look too lofty in our commonwealth: <EOS>
All must be even in our government. <EOS>
You thus employ'd, I will go root away <EOS>
The noisome weeds, which without profit suck <EOS>
The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
Why should we in the compass of a pale <EOS>
Keep law and form and due proportion, <EOS>
Showing, as in a model, our firm estate, <EOS>
When our sea-walled garden, the whole land, <EOS>
Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up, <EOS>
Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd, <EOS>
Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs <EOS>
Swarming with caterpillars? <EOS>
Gardener: <EOS>
Hold thy peace: <EOS>
He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring <EOS>
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf: <EOS>
The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter, <EOS>
That seem'd in eating him to hold him up, <EOS>
Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke, <EOS>
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
What, are they dead? <EOS>
Gardener: <EOS>
They are; and Bolingbroke <EOS>
Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it <EOS>
That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land <EOS>
As we this garden! We at time of year <EOS>
Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees, <EOS>
Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood, <EOS>
With too much riches it confound itself: <EOS>
Had he done so to great and growing men, <EOS>
They might have lived to bear and he to taste <EOS>
Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches <EOS>
We lop away, that bearing boughs may live: <EOS>
Had he done so, himself had borne the crown, <EOS>
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
What, think you then the king shall be deposed? <EOS>
Gardener: <EOS>
Depress'd he is already, and deposed <EOS>
'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night <EOS>
To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's, <EOS>
That tell black tidings. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking! <EOS>
Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden, <EOS>
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news? <EOS>
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee <EOS>
To make a second fall of cursed man? <EOS>
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed? <EOS>
Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth, <EOS>
Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how, <EOS>
Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch. <EOS>
Gardener: <EOS>
Pardon me, madam: little joy have I <EOS>
To breathe this news; yet what I say is true. <EOS>
King Richard, he is in the mighty hold <EOS>
Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd: <EOS>
In your lord's scale is nothing but himself, <EOS>
And some few vanities that make him light; <EOS>
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke, <EOS>
Besides himself, are all the English peers, <EOS>
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down. <EOS>
Post you to London, and you will find it so; <EOS>
I speak no more than every one doth know. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot, <EOS>
Doth not thy embassage belong to me, <EOS>
And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st <EOS>
To serve me last, that I may longest keep <EOS>
Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go, <EOS>
To meet at London London's king in woe. <EOS>
What, was I born to this, that my sad look <EOS>
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke? <EOS>
Gardener, for telling me these news of woe, <EOS>
Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow. <EOS>
GARDENER: <EOS>
Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse, <EOS>
I would my skill were subject to thy curse. <EOS>
Here did she fall a tear; here in this place <EOS>
I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace: <EOS>
Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen, <EOS>
In the remembrance of a weeping queen. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Call forth Bagot. <EOS>
Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind; <EOS>
What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death, <EOS>
Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd <EOS>
The bloody office of his timeless end. <EOS>
BAGOT: <EOS>
Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man. <EOS>
BAGOT: <EOS>
My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue <EOS>
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd. <EOS>
In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted, <EOS>
I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length, <EOS>
That reacheth from the restful English court <EOS>
As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?' <EOS>
Amongst much other talk, that very time, <EOS>
I heard you say that you had rather refuse <EOS>
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns <EOS>
Than Bolingbroke's return to England; <EOS>
Adding withal how blest this land would be <EOS>
In this your cousin's death. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Princes and noble lords, <EOS>
What answer shall I make to this base man? <EOS>
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars, <EOS>
On equal terms to give him chastisement? <EOS>
Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd <EOS>
With the attainder of his slanderous lips. <EOS>
There is my gage, the manual seal of death, <EOS>
That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest, <EOS>
And will maintain what thou hast said is false <EOS>
In thy heart-blood, though being all too base <EOS>
To stain the temper of my knightly sword. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Excepting one, I would he were the best <EOS>
In all this presence that hath moved me so. <EOS>
LORD FITZWATER: <EOS>
If that thy valour stand on sympathy, <EOS>
There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine: <EOS>
By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st, <EOS>
I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it <EOS>
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death. <EOS>
If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest; <EOS>
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart, <EOS>
Where it was forged, with my rapier's point. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day. <EOS>
LORD FITZWATER: <EOS>
Now by my soul, I would it were this hour. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this. <EOS>
HENRY PERCY: <EOS>
Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true <EOS>
In this appeal as thou art all unjust; <EOS>
And that thou art so, there I throw my gage, <EOS>
To prove it on thee to the extremest point <EOS>
Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
An if I do not, may my hands rot off <EOS>
And never brandish more revengeful steel <EOS>
Over the glittering helmet of my foe! <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle; <EOS>
And spur thee on with full as many lies <EOS>
As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear <EOS>
From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn; <EOS>
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all: <EOS>
I have a thousand spirits in one breast, <EOS>
To answer twenty thousand such as you. <EOS>
DUKE OF SURREY: <EOS>
My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well <EOS>
The very time Aumerle and you did talk. <EOS>
LORD FITZWATER: <EOS>
'Tis very true: you were in presence then; <EOS>
And you can witness with me this is true. <EOS>
DUKE OF SURREY: <EOS>
As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true. <EOS>
LORD FITZWATER: <EOS>
Surrey, thou liest. <EOS>
DUKE OF SURREY: <EOS>
Dishonourable boy! <EOS>
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword, <EOS>
That it shall render vengeance and revenge <EOS>
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie <EOS>
In earth as quiet as thy father's skull: <EOS>
In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn; <EOS>
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest. <EOS>
LORD FITZWATER: <EOS>
How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse! <EOS>
If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live, <EOS>
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness, <EOS>
And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies, <EOS>
And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith, <EOS>
To tie thee to my strong correction. <EOS>
As I intend to thrive in this new world, <EOS>
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal: <EOS>
Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say <EOS>
That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men <EOS>
To execute the noble duke at Calais. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Some honest Christian trust me with a gage <EOS>
That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this, <EOS>
If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
These differences shall all rest under gage <EOS>
Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be, <EOS>
And, though mine enemy, restored again <EOS>
To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd, <EOS>
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial. <EOS>
BISHOP OF CARLISLE: <EOS>
That honourable day shall ne'er be seen. <EOS>
Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought <EOS>
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field, <EOS>
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross <EOS>
Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens: <EOS>
And toil'd with works of war, retired himself <EOS>
To Italy; and there at Venice gave <EOS>
His body to that pleasant country's earth, <EOS>
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ, <EOS>
Under whose colours he had fought so long. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead? <EOS>
BISHOP OF CARLISLE: <EOS>
As surely as I live, my lord. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom <EOS>
Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants, <EOS>
Your differences shall all rest under gage <EOS>
Till we assign you to your days of trial. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee <EOS>
From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul <EOS>
Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields <EOS>
To the possession of thy royal hand: <EOS>
Ascend his throne, descending now from him; <EOS>
And long live Henry, fourth of that name! <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne. <EOS>
BISHOP OF CARLISLE: <EOS>
Marry. God forbid! <EOS>
Worst in this royal presence may I speak, <EOS>
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth. <EOS>
Would God that any in this noble presence <EOS>
Were enough noble to be upright judge <EOS>
Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would <EOS>
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong. <EOS>
What subject can give sentence on his king? <EOS>
And who sits here that is not Richard's subject? <EOS>
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear, <EOS>
Although apparent guilt be seen in them; <EOS>
And shall the figure of God's majesty, <EOS>
His captain, steward, deputy-elect, <EOS>
Anointed, crowned, planted many years, <EOS>
Be judged by subject and inferior breath, <EOS>
And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God, <EOS>
That in a Christian climate souls refined <EOS>
Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed! <EOS>
I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks, <EOS>
Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king: <EOS>
My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king, <EOS>
Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king: <EOS>
And if you crown him, let me prophesy: <EOS>
The blood of English shall manure the ground, <EOS>
And future ages groan for this foul act; <EOS>
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels, <EOS>
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars <EOS>
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound; <EOS>
Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny <EOS>
Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd <EOS>
The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls. <EOS>
O, if you raise this house against this house, <EOS>
It will the woefullest division prove <EOS>
That ever fell upon this cursed earth. <EOS>
Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so, <EOS>
Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe! <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains, <EOS>
Of capital treason we arrest you here. <EOS>
My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge <EOS>
To keep him safely till his day of trial. <EOS>
May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Fetch hither Richard, that in common view <EOS>
He may surrender; so we shall proceed <EOS>
Without suspicion. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
I will be his conduct. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Lords, you that here are under our arrest, <EOS>
Procure your sureties for your days of answer. <EOS>
Little are we beholding to your love, <EOS>
And little look'd for at your helping hands. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Alack, why am I sent for to a king, <EOS>
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts <EOS>
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd <EOS>
To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs: <EOS>
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me <EOS>
To this submission. Yet I well remember <EOS>
The favours of these men: were they not mine? <EOS>
Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me? <EOS>
So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve, <EOS>
Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none. <EOS>
God save the king! Will no man say amen? <EOS>
Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen. <EOS>
God save the king! although I be not he; <EOS>
And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me. <EOS>
To do what service am I sent for hither? <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
To do that office of thine own good will <EOS>
Which tired majesty did make thee offer, <EOS>
The resignation of thy state and crown <EOS>
To Henry Bolingbroke. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown; <EOS>
Here cousin: <EOS>
On this side my hand, and on that side yours. <EOS>
Now is this golden crown like a deep well <EOS>
That owes two buckets, filling one another, <EOS>
The emptier ever dancing in the air, <EOS>
The other down, unseen and full of water: <EOS>
That bucket down and full of tears am I, <EOS>
Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
I thought you had been willing to resign. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine: <EOS>
You may my glories and my state depose, <EOS>
But not my griefs; still am I king of those. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Part of your cares you give me with your crown. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down. <EOS>
My care is loss of care, by old care done; <EOS>
Your care is gain of care, by new care won: <EOS>
The cares I give I have, though given away; <EOS>
They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Are you contented to resign the crown? <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be; <EOS>
Therefore no no, for I resign to thee. <EOS>
Now mark me, how I will undo myself; <EOS>
I give this heavy weight from off my head <EOS>
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand, <EOS>
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart; <EOS>
With mine own tears I wash away my balm, <EOS>
With mine own hands I give away my crown, <EOS>
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state, <EOS>
With mine own breath release all duty's rites: <EOS>
All pomp and majesty I do forswear; <EOS>
My manors, rents, revenues I forego; <EOS>
My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny: <EOS>
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me! <EOS>
God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee! <EOS>
Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved, <EOS>
And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved! <EOS>
Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit, <EOS>
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit! <EOS>
God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says, <EOS>
And send him many years of sunshine days! <EOS>
What more remains? <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
No more, but that you read <EOS>
These accusations and these grievous crimes <EOS>
Committed by your person and your followers <EOS>
Against the state and profit of this land; <EOS>
That, by confessing them, the souls of men <EOS>
May deem that you are worthily deposed. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Must I do so? and must I ravel out <EOS>
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland, <EOS>
If thy offences were upon record, <EOS>
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop <EOS>
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst, <EOS>
There shouldst thou find one heinous article, <EOS>
Containing the deposing of a king <EOS>
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath, <EOS>
Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven: <EOS>
Nay, all of you that stand and look upon, <EOS>
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself, <EOS>
Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands <EOS>
Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates <EOS>
Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross, <EOS>
And water cannot wash away your sin. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see: <EOS>
And yet salt water blinds them not so much <EOS>
But they can see a sort of traitors here. <EOS>
Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself, <EOS>
I find myself a traitor with the rest; <EOS>
For I have given here my soul's consent <EOS>
To undeck the pompous body of a king; <EOS>
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave, <EOS>
Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
My lord,-- <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man, <EOS>
Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title, <EOS>
No, not that name was given me at the font, <EOS>
But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day, <EOS>
That I have worn so many winters out, <EOS>
And know not now what name to call myself! <EOS>
O that I were a mockery king of snow, <EOS>
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke, <EOS>
To melt myself away in water-drops! <EOS>
Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good, <EOS>
An if my word be sterling yet in England, <EOS>
Let it command a mirror hither straight, <EOS>
That it may show me what a face I have, <EOS>
Since it is bankrupt of his majesty. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell! <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
The commons will not then be satisfied. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough, <EOS>
When I do see the very book indeed <EOS>
Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself. <EOS>
Give me the glass, and therein will I read. <EOS>
No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck <EOS>
So many blows upon this face of mine, <EOS>
And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass, <EOS>
Like to my followers in prosperity, <EOS>
Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face <EOS>
That every day under his household roof <EOS>
Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face <EOS>
That, like the sun, did make beholders wink? <EOS>
Was this the face that faced so many follies, <EOS>
And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke? <EOS>
A brittle glory shineth in this face: <EOS>
As brittle as the glory is the face; <EOS>
For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers. <EOS>
Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport, <EOS>
How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd <EOS>
The shadow or your face. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Say that again. <EOS>
The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see: <EOS>
'Tis very true, my grief lies all within; <EOS>
And these external manners of laments <EOS>
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief <EOS>
That swells with silence in the tortured soul; <EOS>
There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king, <EOS>
For thy great bounty, that not only givest <EOS>
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way <EOS>
How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon, <EOS>
And then be gone and trouble you no more. <EOS>
Shall I obtain it? <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Name it, fair cousin. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king: <EOS>
For when I was a king, my flatterers <EOS>
Were then but subjects; being now a subject, <EOS>
I have a king here to my flatterer. <EOS>
Being so great, I have no need to beg. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Yet ask. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
And shall I have? <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
You shall. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Then give me leave to go. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Whither? <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Whither you will, so I were from your sights. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Go, some of you convey him to the Tower. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
O, good! convey? conveyers are you all, <EOS>
That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
On Wednesday next we solemnly set down <EOS>
Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves. <EOS>
Abbot: <EOS>
A woeful pageant have we here beheld. <EOS>
BISHOP OF CARLISLE: <EOS>
The woe's to come; the children yet unborn. <EOS>
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
You holy clergymen, is there no plot <EOS>
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot? <EOS>
Abbot: <EOS>
My lord, <EOS>
Before I freely speak my mind herein, <EOS>
You shall not only take the sacrament <EOS>
To bury mine intents, but also to effect <EOS>
Whatever I shall happen to devise. <EOS>
I see your brows are full of discontent, <EOS>
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears: <EOS>
Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay <EOS>
A plot shall show us all a merry day. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
This way the king will come; this is the way <EOS>
To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower, <EOS>
To whose flint bosom my condemned lord <EOS>
Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke: <EOS>
Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth <EOS>
Have any resting for her true king's queen. <EOS>
But soft, but see, or rather do not see, <EOS>
My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold, <EOS>
That you in pity may dissolve to dew, <EOS>
And wash him fresh again with true-love tears. <EOS>
Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand, <EOS>
Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb, <EOS>
And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn, <EOS>
Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee, <EOS>
When triumph is become an alehouse guest? <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so, <EOS>
To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul, <EOS>
To think our former state a happy dream; <EOS>
From which awaked, the truth of what we are <EOS>
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet, <EOS>
To grim Necessity, and he and I <EOS>
Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France <EOS>
And cloister thee in some religious house: <EOS>
Our holy lives must win a new world's crown, <EOS>
Which our profane hours here have stricken down. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
What, is my Richard both in shape and mind <EOS>
Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed <EOS>
Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart? <EOS>
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw, <EOS>
And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage <EOS>
To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like, <EOS>
Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod, <EOS>
And fawn on rage with base humility, <EOS>
Which art a lion and a king of beasts? <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts, <EOS>
I had been still a happy king of men. <EOS>
Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France: <EOS>
Think I am dead and that even here thou takest, <EOS>
As from my death-bed, thy last living leave. <EOS>
In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire <EOS>
With good old folks and let them tell thee tales <EOS>
Of woeful ages long ago betid; <EOS>
And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs, <EOS>
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me <EOS>
And send the hearers weeping to their beds: <EOS>
For why, the senseless brands will sympathize <EOS>
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue <EOS>
And in compassion weep the fire out; <EOS>
And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black, <EOS>
For the deposing of a rightful king. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed: <EOS>
You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower. <EOS>
And, madam, there is order ta'en for you; <EOS>
With all swift speed you must away to France. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal <EOS>
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne, <EOS>
The time shall not be many hours of age <EOS>
More than it is ere foul sin gathering head <EOS>
Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think, <EOS>
Though he divide the realm and give thee half, <EOS>
It is too little, helping him to all; <EOS>
And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way <EOS>
To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again, <EOS>
Being ne'er so little urged, another way <EOS>
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne. <EOS>
The love of wicked men converts to fear; <EOS>
That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both <EOS>
To worthy danger and deserved death. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
My guilt be on my head, and there an end. <EOS>
Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate <EOS>
A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me, <EOS>
And then betwixt me and my married wife. <EOS>
Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me; <EOS>
And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made. <EOS>
Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north, <EOS>
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime; <EOS>
My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp, <EOS>
She came adorned hither like sweet May, <EOS>
Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
And must we be divided? must we part? <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
Banish us both and send the king with me. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
That were some love but little policy. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
Then whither he goes, thither let me go. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
So two, together weeping, make one woe. <EOS>
Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here; <EOS>
Better far off than near, be ne'er the near. <EOS>
Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
So longest way shall have the longest moans. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short, <EOS>
And piece the way out with a heavy heart. <EOS>
Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief, <EOS>
Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief; <EOS>
One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part; <EOS>
Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart. <EOS>
QUEEN: <EOS>
Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part <EOS>
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart. <EOS>
So, now I have mine own again, be gone, <EOS>
That I might strive to kill it with a groan. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
We make woe wanton with this fond delay: <EOS>
Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
My lord, you told me you would tell the rest, <EOS>
When weeping made you break the story off, <EOS>
of our two cousins coming into London. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Where did I leave? <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
At that sad stop, my lord, <EOS>
Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops <EOS>
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke, <EOS>
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed <EOS>
Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know, <EOS>
With slow but stately pace kept on his course, <EOS>
Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee, <EOS>
Bolingbroke!' <EOS>
You would have thought the very windows spake, <EOS>
So many greedy looks of young and old <EOS>
Through casements darted their desiring eyes <EOS>
Upon his visage, and that all the walls <EOS>
With painted imagery had said at once <EOS>
'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!' <EOS>
Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning, <EOS>
Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck, <EOS>
Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:' <EOS>
And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst? <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
As in a theatre, the eyes of men, <EOS>
After a well-graced actor leaves the stage, <EOS>
Are idly bent on him that enters next, <EOS>
Thinking his prattle to be tedious; <EOS>
Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes <EOS>
Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!' <EOS>
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home: <EOS>
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head: <EOS>
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off, <EOS>
His face still combating with tears and smiles, <EOS>
The badges of his grief and patience, <EOS>
That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd <EOS>
The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted <EOS>
And barbarism itself have pitied him. <EOS>
But heaven hath a hand in these events, <EOS>
To whose high will we bound our calm contents. <EOS>
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now, <EOS>
Whose state and honour I for aye allow. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Here comes my son Aumerle. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Aumerle that was; <EOS>
But that is lost for being Richard's friend, <EOS>
And, madam, you must call him Rutland now: <EOS>
I am in parliament pledge for his truth <EOS>
And lasting fealty to the new-made king. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Welcome, my son: who are the violets now <EOS>
That strew the green lap of the new come spring? <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not: <EOS>
God knows I had as lief be none as one. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Well, bear you well in this new spring of time, <EOS>
Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime. <EOS>
What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs? <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
For aught I know, my lord, they do. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
You will be there, I know. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
If God prevent not, I purpose so. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom? <EOS>
Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
My lord, 'tis nothing. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
No matter, then, who see it; <EOS>
I will be satisfied; let me see the writing. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
I do beseech your grace to pardon me: <EOS>
It is a matter of small consequence, <EOS>
Which for some reasons I would not have seen. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see. <EOS>
I fear, I fear,-- <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
What should you fear? <EOS>
'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into <EOS>
For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond <EOS>
That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool. <EOS>
Boy, let me see the writing. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say. <EOS>
Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave! <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
What is the matter, my lord? <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Ho! who is within there? <EOS>
Saddle my horse. <EOS>
God for his mercy, what treachery is here! <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Why, what is it, my lord? <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse. <EOS>
Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth, <EOS>
I will appeach the villain. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
What is the matter? <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Peace, foolish woman. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Good mother, be content; it is no more <EOS>
Than my poor life must answer. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Thy life answer! <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Bring me my boots: I will unto the king. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed. <EOS>
Hence, villain! never more come in my sight. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Give me my boots, I say. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Why, York, what wilt thou do? <EOS>
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own? <EOS>
Have we more sons? or are we like to have? <EOS>
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time? <EOS>
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age, <EOS>
And rob me of a happy mother's name? <EOS>
Is he not like thee? is he not thine own? <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Thou fond mad woman, <EOS>
Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy? <EOS>
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament, <EOS>
And interchangeably set down their hands, <EOS>
To kill the king at Oxford. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
He shall be none; <EOS>
We'll keep him here: then what is that to him? <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son, <EOS>
I would appeach him. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Hadst thou groan'd for him <EOS>
As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful. <EOS>
But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect <EOS>
That I have been disloyal to thy bed, <EOS>
And that he is a bastard, not thy son: <EOS>
Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind: <EOS>
He is as like thee as a man may be, <EOS>
Not like to me, or any of my kin, <EOS>
And yet I love him. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Make way, unruly woman! <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse; <EOS>
Spur post, and get before him to the king, <EOS>
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee. <EOS>
I'll not be long behind; though I be old, <EOS>
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York: <EOS>
And never will I rise up from the ground <EOS>
Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone! <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son? <EOS>
'Tis full three months since I did see him last; <EOS>
If any plague hang over us, 'tis he. <EOS>
I would to God, my lords, he might be found: <EOS>
Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there, <EOS>
For there, they say, he daily doth frequent, <EOS>
With unrestrained loose companions, <EOS>
Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes, <EOS>
And beat our watch, and rob our passengers; <EOS>
Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy, <EOS>
Takes on the point of honour to support <EOS>
So dissolute a crew. <EOS>
HENRY PERCY: <EOS>
My lord, some two days since I saw the prince, <EOS>
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
And what said the gallant? <EOS>
HENRY PERCY: <EOS>
His answer was, he would unto the stews, <EOS>
And from the common'st creature pluck a glove, <EOS>
And wear it as a favour; and with that <EOS>
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
As dissolute as desperate; yet through both <EOS>
I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years <EOS>
May happily bring forth. But who comes here? <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Where is the king? <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
What means our cousin, that he stares and looks <EOS>
So wildly? <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty, <EOS>
To have some conference with your grace alone. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone. <EOS>
What is the matter with our cousin now? <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
For ever may my knees grow to the earth, <EOS>
My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth <EOS>
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Intended or committed was this fault? <EOS>
If on the first, how heinous e'er it be, <EOS>
To win thy after-love I pardon thee. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Then give me leave that I may turn the key, <EOS>
That no man enter till my tale be done. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Have thy desire. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Villain, I'll make thee safe. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
What is the matter, uncle? speak; <EOS>
Recover breath; tell us how near is danger, <EOS>
That we may arm us to encounter it. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know <EOS>
The treason that my haste forbids me show. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd: <EOS>
I do repent me; read not my name there <EOS>
My heart is not confederate with my hand. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down. <EOS>
I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king; <EOS>
Fear, and not love, begets his penitence: <EOS>
Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove <EOS>
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy! <EOS>
O loyal father of a treacherous son! <EOS>
Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain, <EOS>
From when this stream through muddy passages <EOS>
Hath held his current and defiled himself! <EOS>
Thy overflow of good converts to bad, <EOS>
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse <EOS>
This deadly blot in thy digressing son. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd; <EOS>
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame, <EOS>
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold. <EOS>
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies, <EOS>
Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies: <EOS>
Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath, <EOS>
The traitor lives, the true man's put to death. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry? <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I. <EOS>
Speak with me, pity me, open the door. <EOS>
A beggar begs that never begg'd before. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing, <EOS>
And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.' <EOS>
My dangerous cousin, let your mother in: <EOS>
I know she is come to pray for your foul sin. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
If thou do pardon, whosoever pray, <EOS>
More sins for this forgiveness prosper may. <EOS>
This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound; <EOS>
This let alone will all the rest confound. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
O king, believe not this hard-hearted man! <EOS>
Love loving not itself none other can. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here? <EOS>
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear? <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Rise up, good aunt. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Not yet, I thee beseech: <EOS>
For ever will I walk upon my knees, <EOS>
And never see day that the happy sees, <EOS>
Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy, <EOS>
By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy. <EOS>
DUKE OF AUMERLE: <EOS>
Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Against them both my true joints bended be. <EOS>
Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace! <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face; <EOS>
His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest; <EOS>
His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast: <EOS>
He prays but faintly and would be denied; <EOS>
We pray with heart and soul and all beside: <EOS>
His weary joints would gladly rise, I know; <EOS>
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow: <EOS>
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy; <EOS>
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity. <EOS>
Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have <EOS>
That mercy which true prayer ought to have. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Good aunt, stand up. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Nay, do not say, 'stand up;' <EOS>
Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.' <EOS>
And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach, <EOS>
'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech. <EOS>
I never long'd to hear a word till now; <EOS>
Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how: <EOS>
The word is short, but not so short as sweet; <EOS>
No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet. <EOS>
DUKE OF YORK: <EOS>
Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.' <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy? <EOS>
Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord, <EOS>
That set'st the word itself against the word! <EOS>
Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land; <EOS>
The chopping French we do not understand. <EOS>
Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there; <EOS>
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear; <EOS>
That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce, <EOS>
Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Good aunt, stand up. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
I do not sue to stand; <EOS>
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
I pardon him, as God shall pardon me. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
O happy vantage of a kneeling knee! <EOS>
Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again; <EOS>
Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain, <EOS>
But makes one pardon strong. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
With all my heart <EOS>
I pardon him. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
A god on earth thou art. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot, <EOS>
With all the rest of that consorted crew, <EOS>
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels. <EOS>
Good uncle, help to order several powers <EOS>
To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are: <EOS>
They shall not live within this world, I swear, <EOS>
But I will have them, if I once know where. <EOS>
Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu: <EOS>
Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true. <EOS>
DUCHESS OF YORK: <EOS>
Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new. <EOS>
EXTON: <EOS>
Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake, <EOS>
'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?' <EOS>
Was it not so? <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
These were his very words. <EOS>
EXTON: <EOS>
'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice, <EOS>
And urged it twice together, did he not? <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
He did. <EOS>
EXTON: <EOS>
And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me, <EOS>
And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man' <EOS>
That would divorce this terror from my heart;' <EOS>
Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go: <EOS>
I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
I have been studying how I may compare <EOS>
This prison where I live unto the world: <EOS>
And for because the world is populous <EOS>
And here is not a creature but myself, <EOS>
I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out. <EOS>
My brain I'll prove the female to my soul, <EOS>
My soul the father; and these two beget <EOS>
A generation of still-breeding thoughts, <EOS>
And these same thoughts people this little world, <EOS>
In humours like the people of this world, <EOS>
For no thought is contented. The better sort, <EOS>
As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd <EOS>
With scruples and do set the word itself <EOS>
Against the word: <EOS>
As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again, <EOS>
'It is as hard to come as for a camel <EOS>
To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.' <EOS>
Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot <EOS>
Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails <EOS>
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs <EOS>
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls, <EOS>
And, for they cannot, die in their own pride. <EOS>
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves <EOS>
That they are not the first of fortune's slaves, <EOS>
Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars <EOS>
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame, <EOS>
That many have and others must sit there; <EOS>
And in this thought they find a kind of ease, <EOS>
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back <EOS>
Of such as have before endured the like. <EOS>
Thus play I in one person many people, <EOS>
And none contented: sometimes am I king; <EOS>
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar, <EOS>
And so I am: then crushing penury <EOS>
Persuades me I was better when a king; <EOS>
Then am I king'd again: and by and by <EOS>
Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke, <EOS>
And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be, <EOS>
Nor I nor any man that but man is <EOS>
With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased <EOS>
With being nothing. Music do I hear? <EOS>
Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is, <EOS>
When time is broke and no proportion kept! <EOS>
So is it in the music of men's lives. <EOS>
And here have I the daintiness of ear <EOS>
To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string; <EOS>
But for the concord of my state and time <EOS>
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke. <EOS>
I wasted time, and now doth time waste me; <EOS>
For now hath time made me his numbering clock: <EOS>
My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar <EOS>
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch, <EOS>
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point, <EOS>
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears. <EOS>
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is <EOS>
Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart, <EOS>
Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans <EOS>
Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time <EOS>
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy, <EOS>
While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock. <EOS>
This music mads me; let it sound no more; <EOS>
For though it have holp madmen to their wits, <EOS>
In me it seems it will make wise men mad. <EOS>
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me! <EOS>
For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard <EOS>
Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world. <EOS>
Groom: <EOS>
Hail, royal prince! <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Thanks, noble peer; <EOS>
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear. <EOS>
What art thou? and how comest thou hither, <EOS>
Where no man never comes but that sad dog <EOS>
That brings me food to make misfortune live? <EOS>
Groom: <EOS>
I was a poor groom of thy stable, king, <EOS>
When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York, <EOS>
With much ado at length have gotten leave <EOS>
To look upon my sometimes royal master's face. <EOS>
O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld <EOS>
In London streets, that coronation-day, <EOS>
When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary, <EOS>
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid, <EOS>
That horse that I so carefully have dress'd! <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend, <EOS>
How went he under him? <EOS>
Groom: <EOS>
So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back! <EOS>
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand; <EOS>
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him. <EOS>
Would he not stumble? would he not fall down, <EOS>
Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck <EOS>
Of that proud man that did usurp his back? <EOS>
Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee, <EOS>
Since thou, created to be awed by man, <EOS>
Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse; <EOS>
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass, <EOS>
Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke. <EOS>
Keeper: <EOS>
Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away. <EOS>
Groom: <EOS>
What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say. <EOS>
Keeper: <EOS>
My lord, will't please you to fall to? <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do. <EOS>
Keeper: <EOS>
My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who <EOS>
lately came from the king, commands the contrary. <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee! <EOS>
Patience is stale, and I am weary of it. <EOS>
Keeper: <EOS>
Help, help, help! <EOS>
KING RICHARD II: <EOS>
How now! what means death in this rude assault? <EOS>
Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument. <EOS>
Go thou, and fill another room in hell. <EOS>
That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire <EOS>
That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand <EOS>
Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land. <EOS>
Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high; <EOS>
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die. <EOS>
EXTON: <EOS>
As full of valour as of royal blood: <EOS>
Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good! <EOS>
For now the devil, that told me I did well, <EOS>
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell. <EOS>
This dead king to the living king I'll bear <EOS>
Take hence the rest, and give them burial here. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear <EOS>
Is that the rebels have consumed with fire <EOS>
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire; <EOS>
But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not. <EOS>
Welcome, my lord what is the news? <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness. <EOS>
The next news is, I have to London sent <EOS>
The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent: <EOS>
The manner of their taking may appear <EOS>
At large discoursed in this paper here. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains; <EOS>
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains. <EOS>
LORD FITZWATER: <EOS>
My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London <EOS>
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely, <EOS>
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors <EOS>
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot; <EOS>
Right noble is thy merit, well I wot. <EOS>
HENRY PERCY: <EOS>
The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster, <EOS>
With clog of conscience and sour melancholy <EOS>
Hath yielded up his body to the grave; <EOS>
But here is Carlisle living, to abide <EOS>
Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Carlisle, this is your doom: <EOS>
Choose out some secret place, some reverend room, <EOS>
More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life; <EOS>
So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife: <EOS>
For though mine enemy thou hast ever been, <EOS>
High sparks of honour in thee have I seen. <EOS>
EXTON: <EOS>
Great king, within this coffin I present <EOS>
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies <EOS>
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies, <EOS>
Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought <EOS>
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand <EOS>
Upon my head and all this famous land. <EOS>
EXTON: <EOS>
From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed. <EOS>
HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <EOS>
They love not poison that do poison need, <EOS>
Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead, <EOS>
I hate the murderer, love him murdered. <EOS>
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour, <EOS>
But neither my good word nor princely favour: <EOS>
With Cain go wander through shades of night, <EOS>
And never show thy head by day nor light. <EOS>
Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe, <EOS>
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow: <EOS>
Come, mourn with me for that I do lament, <EOS>
And put on sullen black incontinent: <EOS>
I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land, <EOS>
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand: <EOS>
March sadly after; grace my mournings here; <EOS>
In weeping after this untimely bier. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals. <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
No, for then we should be colliers. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw. <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
I strike quickly, being moved. <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
But thou art not quickly moved to strike. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
A dog of the house of Montague moves me. <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: <EOS>
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will <EOS>
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's. <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes <EOS>
to the wall. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, <EOS>
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push <EOS>
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids <EOS>
to the wall. <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I <EOS>
have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the <EOS>
maids, and cut off their heads. <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
The heads of the maids? <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; <EOS>
take it in what sense thou wilt. <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
They must take it in sense that feel it. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and <EOS>
'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh. <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou <EOS>
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes <EOS>
two of the house of the Montagues. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee. <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
How! turn thy back and run? <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
Fear me not. <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
No, marry; I fear thee! <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as <EOS>
they list. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; <EOS>
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it. <EOS>
ABRAHAM: <EOS>
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
I do bite my thumb, sir. <EOS>
ABRAHAM: <EOS>
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
No. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I <EOS>
bite my thumb, sir. <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
Do you quarrel, sir? <EOS>
ABRAHAM: <EOS>
Quarrel sir! no, sir. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you. <EOS>
ABRAHAM: <EOS>
No better. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
Well, sir. <EOS>
GREGORY: <EOS>
Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
Yes, better, sir. <EOS>
ABRAHAM: <EOS>
You lie. <EOS>
SAMPSON: <EOS>
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Part, fools! <EOS>
Put up your swords; you know not what you do. <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? <EOS>
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword, <EOS>
Or manage it to part these men with me. <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word, <EOS>
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee: <EOS>
Have at thee, coward! <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down! <EOS>
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues! <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword? <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come, <EOS>
And flourishes his blade in spite of me. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go. <EOS>
LADY MONTAGUE: <EOS>
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe. <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, <EOS>
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,-- <EOS>
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts, <EOS>
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage <EOS>
With purple fountains issuing from your veins, <EOS>
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands <EOS>
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground, <EOS>
And hear the sentence of your moved prince. <EOS>
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, <EOS>
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, <EOS>
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets, <EOS>
And made Verona's ancient citizens <EOS>
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, <EOS>
To wield old partisans, in hands as old, <EOS>
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate: <EOS>
If ever you disturb our streets again, <EOS>
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. <EOS>
For this time, all the rest depart away: <EOS>
You Capulet; shall go along with me: <EOS>
And, Montague, come you this afternoon, <EOS>
To know our further pleasure in this case, <EOS>
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place. <EOS>
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? <EOS>
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Here were the servants of your adversary, <EOS>
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach: <EOS>
I drew to part them: in the instant came <EOS>
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared, <EOS>
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears, <EOS>
He swung about his head and cut the winds, <EOS>
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn: <EOS>
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, <EOS>
Came more and more and fought on part and part, <EOS>
Till the prince came, who parted either part. <EOS>
LADY MONTAGUE: <EOS>
O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day? <EOS>
Right glad I am he was not at this fray. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun <EOS>
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east, <EOS>
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; <EOS>
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore <EOS>
That westward rooteth from the city's side, <EOS>
So early walking did I see your son: <EOS>
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me <EOS>
And stole into the covert of the wood: <EOS>
I, measuring his affections by my own, <EOS>
That most are busied when they're most alone, <EOS>
Pursued my humour not pursuing his, <EOS>
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
Many a morning hath he there been seen, <EOS>
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew. <EOS>
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; <EOS>
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun <EOS>
Should in the furthest east begin to draw <EOS>
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, <EOS>
Away from the light steals home my heavy son, <EOS>
And private in his chamber pens himself, <EOS>
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out <EOS>
And makes himself an artificial night: <EOS>
Black and portentous must this humour prove, <EOS>
Unless good counsel may the cause remove. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
My noble uncle, do you know the cause? <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
I neither know it nor can learn of him. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Have you importuned him by any means? <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
Both by myself and many other friends: <EOS>
But he, his own affections' counsellor, <EOS>
Is to himself--I will not say how true-- <EOS>
But to himself so secret and so close, <EOS>
So far from sounding and discovery, <EOS>
As is the bud bit with an envious worm, <EOS>
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, <EOS>
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. <EOS>
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow. <EOS>
We would as willingly give cure as know. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
See, where he comes: so please you, step aside; <EOS>
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay, <EOS>
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Good-morrow, cousin. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Is the day so young? <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
But new struck nine. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Ay me! sad hours seem long. <EOS>
Was that my father that went hence so fast? <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Not having that, which, having, makes them short. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
In love? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Out-- <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Of love? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Out of her favour, where I am in love. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, <EOS>
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof! <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, <EOS>
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! <EOS>
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? <EOS>
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. <EOS>
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. <EOS>
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! <EOS>
O any thing, of nothing first create! <EOS>
O heavy lightness! serious vanity! <EOS>
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms! <EOS>
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, <EOS>
sick health! <EOS>
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! <EOS>
This love feel I, that feel no love in this. <EOS>
Dost thou not laugh? <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
No, coz, I rather weep. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Good heart, at what? <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
At thy good heart's oppression. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Why, such is love's transgression. <EOS>
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, <EOS>
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest <EOS>
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown <EOS>
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. <EOS>
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs; <EOS>
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes; <EOS>
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears: <EOS>
What is it else? a madness most discreet, <EOS>
A choking gall and a preserving sweet. <EOS>
Farewell, my coz. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Soft! I will go along; <EOS>
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here; <EOS>
This is not Romeo, he's some other where. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
What, shall I groan and tell thee? <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Groan! why, no. <EOS>
But sadly tell me who. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will: <EOS>
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill! <EOS>
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit <EOS>
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit; <EOS>
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd, <EOS>
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd. <EOS>
She will not stay the siege of loving terms, <EOS>
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, <EOS>
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold: <EOS>
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor, <EOS>
That when she dies with beauty dies her store. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, <EOS>
For beauty starved with her severity <EOS>
Cuts beauty off from all posterity. <EOS>
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, <EOS>
To merit bliss by making me despair: <EOS>
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow <EOS>
Do I live dead that live to tell it now. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
O, teach me how I should forget to think. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; <EOS>
Examine other beauties. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
'Tis the way <EOS>
To call hers exquisite, in question more: <EOS>
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows <EOS>
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair; <EOS>
He that is strucken blind cannot forget <EOS>
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost: <EOS>
Show me a mistress that is passing fair, <EOS>
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note <EOS>
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair? <EOS>
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
But Montague is bound as well as I, <EOS>
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think, <EOS>
For men so old as we to keep the peace. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
Of honourable reckoning are you both; <EOS>
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long. <EOS>
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit? <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
But saying o'er what I have said before: <EOS>
My child is yet a stranger in the world; <EOS>
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years, <EOS>
Let two more summers wither in their pride, <EOS>
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
Younger than she are happy mothers made. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
And too soon marr'd are those so early made. <EOS>
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she, <EOS>
She is the hopeful lady of my earth: <EOS>
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart, <EOS>
My will to her consent is but a part; <EOS>
An she agree, within her scope of choice <EOS>
Lies my consent and fair according voice. <EOS>
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast, <EOS>
Whereto I have invited many a guest, <EOS>
Such as I love; and you, among the store, <EOS>
One more, most welcome, makes my number more. <EOS>
At my poor house look to behold this night <EOS>
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light: <EOS>
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel <EOS>
When well-apparell'd April on the heel <EOS>
Of limping winter treads, even such delight <EOS>
Among fresh female buds shall you this night <EOS>
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see, <EOS>
And like her most whose merit most shall be: <EOS>
Which on more view, of many mine being one <EOS>
May stand in number, though in reckoning none, <EOS>
Come, go with me. <EOS>
Go, sirrah, trudge about <EOS>
Through fair Verona; find those persons out <EOS>
Whose names are written there, and to them say, <EOS>
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
Find them out whose names are written here! It is <EOS>
written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his <EOS>
yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with <EOS>
his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am <EOS>
sent to find those persons whose names are here <EOS>
writ, and can never find what names the writing <EOS>
person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning, <EOS>
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish; <EOS>
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; <EOS>
One desperate grief cures with another's languish: <EOS>
Take thou some new infection to thy eye, <EOS>
And the rank poison of the old will die. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
For what, I pray thee? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
For your broken shin. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Why, Romeo, art thou mad? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; <EOS>
Shut up in prison, kept without my food, <EOS>
Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I <EOS>
pray, can you read any thing you see? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Ay, if I know the letters and the language. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
Ye say honestly: rest you merry! <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Stay, fellow; I can read. <EOS>
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; <EOS>
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady <EOS>
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely <EOS>
nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine <EOS>
uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece <EOS>
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin <EOS>
Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair <EOS>
assembly: whither should they come? <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
Up. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Whither? <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
To supper; to our house. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Whose house? <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
My master's. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the <EOS>
great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house <EOS>
of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine. <EOS>
Rest you merry! <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's <EOS>
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest, <EOS>
With all the admired beauties of Verona: <EOS>
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye, <EOS>
Compare her face with some that I shall show, <EOS>
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
When the devout religion of mine eye <EOS>
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires; <EOS>
And these, who often drown'd could never die, <EOS>
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! <EOS>
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun <EOS>
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by, <EOS>
Herself poised with herself in either eye: <EOS>
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd <EOS>
Your lady's love against some other maid <EOS>
That I will show you shining at this feast, <EOS>
And she shall scant show well that now shows best. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown, <EOS>
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old, <EOS>
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird! <EOS>
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
How now! who calls? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Your mother. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Madam, I am here. <EOS>
What is your will? <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile, <EOS>
We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again; <EOS>
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. <EOS>
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
She's not fourteen. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,-- <EOS>
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four-- <EOS>
She is not fourteen. How long is it now <EOS>
To Lammas-tide? <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
A fortnight and odd days. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Even or odd, of all days in the year, <EOS>
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen. <EOS>
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!-- <EOS>
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God; <EOS>
She was too good for me: but, as I said, <EOS>
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen; <EOS>
That shall she, marry; I remember it well. <EOS>
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; <EOS>
And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,-- <EOS>
Of all the days of the year, upon that day: <EOS>
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, <EOS>
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall; <EOS>
My lord and you were then at Mantua:-- <EOS>
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said, <EOS>
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple <EOS>
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, <EOS>
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug! <EOS>
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow, <EOS>
To bid me trudge: <EOS>
And since that time it is eleven years; <EOS>
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood, <EOS>
She could have run and waddled all about; <EOS>
For even the day before, she broke her brow: <EOS>
And then my husband--God be with his soul! <EOS>
A' was a merry man--took up the child: <EOS>
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face? <EOS>
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; <EOS>
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame, <EOS>
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.' <EOS>
To see, now, how a jest shall come about! <EOS>
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years, <EOS>
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he; <EOS>
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.' <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh, <EOS>
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.' <EOS>
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow <EOS>
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone; <EOS>
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly: <EOS>
'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face? <EOS>
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age; <EOS>
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.' <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace! <EOS>
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed: <EOS>
An I might live to see thee married once, <EOS>
I have my wish. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme <EOS>
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, <EOS>
How stands your disposition to be married? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
It is an honour that I dream not of. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
An honour! were not I thine only nurse, <EOS>
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Well, think of marriage now; younger than you, <EOS>
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, <EOS>
Are made already mothers: by my count, <EOS>
I was your mother much upon these years <EOS>
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief: <EOS>
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
A man, young lady! lady, such a man <EOS>
As all the world--why, he's a man of wax. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Verona's summer hath not such a flower. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
What say you? can you love the gentleman? <EOS>
This night you shall behold him at our feast; <EOS>
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, <EOS>
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; <EOS>
Examine every married lineament, <EOS>
And see how one another lends content <EOS>
And what obscured in this fair volume lies <EOS>
Find written in the margent of his eyes. <EOS>
This precious book of love, this unbound lover, <EOS>
To beautify him, only lacks a cover: <EOS>
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride <EOS>
For fair without the fair within to hide: <EOS>
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory, <EOS>
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story; <EOS>
So shall you share all that he doth possess, <EOS>
By having him, making yourself no less. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I'll look to like, if looking liking move: <EOS>
But no more deep will I endart mine eye <EOS>
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you <EOS>
called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in <EOS>
the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must <EOS>
hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
We follow thee. <EOS>
Juliet, the county stays. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse? <EOS>
Or shall we on without a apology? <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
The date is out of such prolixity: <EOS>
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf, <EOS>
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath, <EOS>
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper; <EOS>
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke <EOS>
After the prompter, for our entrance: <EOS>
But let them measure us by what they will; <EOS>
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling; <EOS>
Being but heavy, I will bear the light. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes <EOS>
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead <EOS>
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, <EOS>
And soar with them above a common bound. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft <EOS>
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound, <EOS>
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe: <EOS>
Under love's heavy burden do I sink. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
And, to sink in it, should you burden love; <EOS>
Too great oppression for a tender thing. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Is love a tender thing? it is too rough, <EOS>
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
If love be rough with you, be rough with love; <EOS>
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. <EOS>
Give me a case to put my visage in: <EOS>
A visor for a visor! what care I <EOS>
What curious eye doth quote deformities? <EOS>
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in, <EOS>
But every man betake him to his legs. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
A torch for me: let wantons light of heart <EOS>
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels, <EOS>
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase; <EOS>
I'll be a candle-holder, and look on. <EOS>
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word: <EOS>
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire <EOS>
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st <EOS>
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho! <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Nay, that's not so. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
I mean, sir, in delay <EOS>
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day. <EOS>
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits <EOS>
Five times in that ere once in our five wits. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
And we mean well in going to this mask; <EOS>
But 'tis no wit to go. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Why, may one ask? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I dream'd a dream to-night. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
And so did I. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Well, what was yours? <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
That dreamers often lie. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. <EOS>
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes <EOS>
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone <EOS>
On the fore-finger of an alderman, <EOS>
Drawn with a team of little atomies <EOS>
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep; <EOS>
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs, <EOS>
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers, <EOS>
The traces of the smallest spider's web, <EOS>
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams, <EOS>
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film, <EOS>
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, <EOS>
Not so big as a round little worm <EOS>
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid; <EOS>
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut <EOS>
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, <EOS>
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers. <EOS>
And in this state she gallops night by night <EOS>
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; <EOS>
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight, <EOS>
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, <EOS>
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream, <EOS>
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, <EOS>
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: <EOS>
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, <EOS>
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; <EOS>
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail <EOS>
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep, <EOS>
Then dreams, he of another benefice: <EOS>
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, <EOS>
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, <EOS>
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, <EOS>
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon <EOS>
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, <EOS>
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two <EOS>
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab <EOS>
That plats the manes of horses in the night, <EOS>
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, <EOS>
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes: <EOS>
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, <EOS>
That presses them and learns them first to bear, <EOS>
Making them women of good carriage: <EOS>
This is she-- <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! <EOS>
Thou talk'st of nothing. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
True, I talk of dreams, <EOS>
Which are the children of an idle brain, <EOS>
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, <EOS>
Which is as thin of substance as the air <EOS>
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes <EOS>
Even now the frozen bosom of the north, <EOS>
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, <EOS>
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; <EOS>
Supper is done, and we shall come too late. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives <EOS>
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars <EOS>
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date <EOS>
With this night's revels and expire the term <EOS>
Of a despised life closed in my breast <EOS>
By some vile forfeit of untimely death. <EOS>
But He, that hath the steerage of my course, <EOS>
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Strike, drum. <EOS>
First Servant: <EOS>
Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He <EOS>
shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher! <EOS>
Second Servant: <EOS>
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's <EOS>
hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing. <EOS>
First Servant: <EOS>
Away with the joint-stools, remove the <EOS>
court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save <EOS>
me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let <EOS>
the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. <EOS>
Antony, and Potpan! <EOS>
Second Servant: <EOS>
Ay, boy, ready. <EOS>
First Servant: <EOS>
You are looked for and called for, asked for and <EOS>
sought for, in the great chamber. <EOS>
Second Servant: <EOS>
We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be <EOS>
brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes <EOS>
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you. <EOS>
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all <EOS>
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, <EOS>
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now? <EOS>
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day <EOS>
That I have worn a visor and could tell <EOS>
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear, <EOS>
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone: <EOS>
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play. <EOS>
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls. <EOS>
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up, <EOS>
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot. <EOS>
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well. <EOS>
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet; <EOS>
For you and I are past our dancing days: <EOS>
How long is't now since last yourself and I <EOS>
Were in a mask? <EOS>
Second Capulet: <EOS>
By'r lady, thirty years. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much: <EOS>
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio, <EOS>
Come pentecost as quickly as it will, <EOS>
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd. <EOS>
Second Capulet: <EOS>
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir; <EOS>
His son is thirty. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Will you tell me that? <EOS>
His son was but a ward two years ago. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
I know not, sir. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! <EOS>
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night <EOS>
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear; <EOS>
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! <EOS>
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows, <EOS>
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows. <EOS>
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand, <EOS>
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. <EOS>
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! <EOS>
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night. <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
This, by his voice, should be a Montague. <EOS>
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave <EOS>
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face, <EOS>
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? <EOS>
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, <EOS>
To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so? <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe, <EOS>
A villain that is hither come in spite, <EOS>
To scorn at our solemnity this night. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Young Romeo is it? <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
'Tis he, that villain Romeo. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone; <EOS>
He bears him like a portly gentleman; <EOS>
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him <EOS>
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth: <EOS>
I would not for the wealth of all the town <EOS>
Here in my house do him disparagement: <EOS>
Therefore be patient, take no note of him: <EOS>
It is my will, the which if thou respect, <EOS>
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, <EOS>
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast. <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
It fits, when such a villain is a guest: <EOS>
I'll not endure him. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
He shall be endured: <EOS>
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; <EOS>
Am I the master here, or you? go to. <EOS>
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul! <EOS>
You'll make a mutiny among my guests! <EOS>
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man! <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Go to, go to; <EOS>
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed? <EOS>
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what: <EOS>
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time. <EOS>
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go: <EOS>
Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame! <EOS>
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts! <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting <EOS>
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. <EOS>
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall <EOS>
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, <EOS>
Which mannerly devotion shows in this; <EOS>
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, <EOS>
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; <EOS>
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. <EOS>
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Then have my lips the sin that they have took. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged! <EOS>
Give me my sin again. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
You kiss by the book. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
What is her mother? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Marry, bachelor, <EOS>
Her mother is the lady of the house, <EOS>
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous <EOS>
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal; <EOS>
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her <EOS>
Shall have the chinks. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Is she a Capulet? <EOS>
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Away, begone; the sport is at the best. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone; <EOS>
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. <EOS>
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all <EOS>
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night. <EOS>
More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed. <EOS>
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late: <EOS>
I'll to my rest. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
The son and heir of old Tiberio. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
What's he that now is going out of door? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
What's he that follows there, that would not dance? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
I know not. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Go ask his name: if he be married. <EOS>
My grave is like to be my wedding bed. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
His name is Romeo, and a Montague; <EOS>
The only son of your great enemy. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
My only love sprung from my only hate! <EOS>
Too early seen unknown, and known too late! <EOS>
Prodigious birth of love it is to me, <EOS>
That I must love a loathed enemy. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
What's this? what's this? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
A rhyme I learn'd even now <EOS>
Of one I danced withal. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Anon, anon! <EOS>
Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone. <EOS>
Chorus: <EOS>
Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie, <EOS>
And young affection gapes to be his heir; <EOS>
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die, <EOS>
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair. <EOS>
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, <EOS>
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks, <EOS>
But to his foe supposed he must complain, <EOS>
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks: <EOS>
Being held a foe, he may not have access <EOS>
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear; <EOS>
And she as much in love, her means much less <EOS>
To meet her new-beloved any where: <EOS>
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet <EOS>
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Can I go forward when my heart is here? <EOS>
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Romeo! my cousin Romeo! <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
He is wise; <EOS>
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall: <EOS>
Call, good Mercutio. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Nay, I'll conjure too. <EOS>
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! <EOS>
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh: <EOS>
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied; <EOS>
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;' <EOS>
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word, <EOS>
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir, <EOS>
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim, <EOS>
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid! <EOS>
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not; <EOS>
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him. <EOS>
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, <EOS>
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, <EOS>
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh <EOS>
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, <EOS>
That in thy likeness thou appear to us! <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him <EOS>
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle <EOS>
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand <EOS>
Till she had laid it and conjured it down; <EOS>
That were some spite: my invocation <EOS>
Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name <EOS>
I conjure only but to raise up him. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees, <EOS>
To be consorted with the humorous night: <EOS>
Blind is his love and best befits the dark. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. <EOS>
Now will he sit under a medlar tree, <EOS>
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit <EOS>
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone. <EOS>
Romeo, that she were, O, that she were <EOS>
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear! <EOS>
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; <EOS>
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep: <EOS>
Come, shall we go? <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Go, then; for 'tis in vain <EOS>
To seek him here that means not to be found. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. <EOS>
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? <EOS>
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. <EOS>
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, <EOS>
Who is already sick and pale with grief, <EOS>
That thou her maid art far more fair than she: <EOS>
Be not her maid, since she is envious; <EOS>
Her vestal livery is but sick and green <EOS>
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off. <EOS>
It is my lady, O, it is my love! <EOS>
O, that she knew she were! <EOS>
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that? <EOS>
Her eye discourses; I will answer it. <EOS>
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks: <EOS>
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, <EOS>
Having some business, do entreat her eyes <EOS>
To twinkle in their spheres till they return. <EOS>
What if her eyes were there, they in her head? <EOS>
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars, <EOS>
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven <EOS>
Would through the airy region stream so bright <EOS>
That birds would sing and think it were not night. <EOS>
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand! <EOS>
O, that I were a glove upon that hand, <EOS>
That I might touch that cheek! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Ay me! <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
She speaks: <EOS>
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art <EOS>
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head <EOS>
As is a winged messenger of heaven <EOS>
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes <EOS>
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him <EOS>
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds <EOS>
And sails upon the bosom of the air. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? <EOS>
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; <EOS>
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, <EOS>
And I'll no longer be a Capulet. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; <EOS>
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. <EOS>
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, <EOS>
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part <EOS>
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! <EOS>
What's in a name? that which we call a rose <EOS>
By any other name would smell as sweet; <EOS>
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, <EOS>
Retain that dear perfection which he owes <EOS>
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name, <EOS>
And for that name which is no part of thee <EOS>
Take all myself. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I take thee at thy word: <EOS>
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized; <EOS>
Henceforth I never will be Romeo. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night <EOS>
So stumblest on my counsel? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
By a name <EOS>
I know not how to tell thee who I am: <EOS>
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, <EOS>
Because it is an enemy to thee; <EOS>
Had I it written, I would tear the word. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words <EOS>
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound: <EOS>
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? <EOS>
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, <EOS>
And the place death, considering who thou art, <EOS>
If any of my kinsmen find thee here. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; <EOS>
For stony limits cannot hold love out, <EOS>
And what love can do that dares love attempt; <EOS>
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
If they do see thee, they will murder thee. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye <EOS>
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet, <EOS>
And I am proof against their enmity. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I would not for the world they saw thee here. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight; <EOS>
And but thou love me, let them find me here: <EOS>
My life were better ended by their hate, <EOS>
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
By whose direction found'st thou out this place? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire; <EOS>
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes. <EOS>
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far <EOS>
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea, <EOS>
I would adventure for such merchandise. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, <EOS>
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek <EOS>
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night <EOS>
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny <EOS>
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! <EOS>
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' <EOS>
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, <EOS>
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries <EOS>
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, <EOS>
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully: <EOS>
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won, <EOS>
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay, <EOS>
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world. <EOS>
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, <EOS>
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light: <EOS>
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true <EOS>
Than those that have more cunning to be strange. <EOS>
I should have been more strange, I must confess, <EOS>
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware, <EOS>
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me, <EOS>
And not impute this yielding to light love, <EOS>
Which the dark night hath so discovered. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear <EOS>
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-- <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, <EOS>
That monthly changes in her circled orb, <EOS>
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
What shall I swear by? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Do not swear at all; <EOS>
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, <EOS>
Which is the god of my idolatry, <EOS>
And I'll believe thee. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
If my heart's dear love-- <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee, <EOS>
I have no joy of this contract to-night: <EOS>
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; <EOS>
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be <EOS>
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! <EOS>
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, <EOS>
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. <EOS>
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest <EOS>
Come to thy heart as that within my breast! <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it: <EOS>
And yet I would it were to give again. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
But to be frank, and give it thee again. <EOS>
And yet I wish but for the thing I have: <EOS>
My bounty is as boundless as the sea, <EOS>
My love as deep; the more I give to thee, <EOS>
The more I have, for both are infinite. <EOS>
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu! <EOS>
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true. <EOS>
Stay but a little, I will come again. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard. <EOS>
Being in night, all this is but a dream, <EOS>
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. <EOS>
If that thy bent of love be honourable, <EOS>
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, <EOS>
By one that I'll procure to come to thee, <EOS>
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; <EOS>
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay <EOS>
And follow thee my lord throughout the world. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well, <EOS>
I do beseech thee-- <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
By and by, I come:-- <EOS>
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief: <EOS>
To-morrow will I send. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
So thrive my soul-- <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
A thousand times good night! <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. <EOS>
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from <EOS>
their books, <EOS>
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice, <EOS>
To lure this tassel-gentle back again! <EOS>
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud; <EOS>
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, <EOS>
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine, <EOS>
With repetition of my Romeo's name. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
It is my soul that calls upon my name: <EOS>
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, <EOS>
Like softest music to attending ears! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Romeo! <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
My dear? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
At what o'clock to-morrow <EOS>
Shall I send to thee? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
At the hour of nine. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then. <EOS>
I have forgot why I did call thee back. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Let me stand here till thou remember it. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there, <EOS>
Remembering how I love thy company. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget, <EOS>
Forgetting any other home but this. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone: <EOS>
And yet no further than a wanton's bird; <EOS>
Who lets it hop a little from her hand, <EOS>
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, <EOS>
And with a silk thread plucks it back again, <EOS>
So loving-jealous of his liberty. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I would I were thy bird. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Sweet, so would I: <EOS>
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. <EOS>
Good night, good night! parting is such <EOS>
sweet sorrow, <EOS>
That I shall say good night till it be morrow. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast! <EOS>
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest! <EOS>
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell, <EOS>
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night, <EOS>
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light, <EOS>
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels <EOS>
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels: <EOS>
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, <EOS>
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, <EOS>
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours <EOS>
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers. <EOS>
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb; <EOS>
What is her burying grave that is her womb, <EOS>
And from her womb children of divers kind <EOS>
We sucking on her natural bosom find, <EOS>
Many for many virtues excellent, <EOS>
None but for some and yet all different. <EOS>
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies <EOS>
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities: <EOS>
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live <EOS>
But to the earth some special good doth give, <EOS>
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use <EOS>
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: <EOS>
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied; <EOS>
And vice sometimes by action dignified. <EOS>
Within the infant rind of this small flower <EOS>
Poison hath residence and medicine power: <EOS>
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; <EOS>
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. <EOS>
Two such opposed kings encamp them still <EOS>
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; <EOS>
And where the worser is predominant, <EOS>
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Good morrow, father. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Benedicite! <EOS>
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? <EOS>
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head <EOS>
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed: <EOS>
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye, <EOS>
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie; <EOS>
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain <EOS>
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign: <EOS>
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure <EOS>
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature; <EOS>
Or if not so, then here I hit it right, <EOS>
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no; <EOS>
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again. <EOS>
I have been feasting with mine enemy, <EOS>
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me, <EOS>
That's by me wounded: both our remedies <EOS>
Within thy help and holy physic lies: <EOS>
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, <EOS>
My intercession likewise steads my foe. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; <EOS>
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set <EOS>
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet: <EOS>
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; <EOS>
And all combined, save what thou must combine <EOS>
By holy marriage: when and where and how <EOS>
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow, <EOS>
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, <EOS>
That thou consent to marry us to-day. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! <EOS>
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, <EOS>
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies <EOS>
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. <EOS>
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine <EOS>
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! <EOS>
How much salt water thrown away in waste, <EOS>
To season love, that of it doth not taste! <EOS>
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, <EOS>
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears; <EOS>
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit <EOS>
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet: <EOS>
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, <EOS>
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline: <EOS>
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then, <EOS>
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
And bad'st me bury love. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Not in a grave, <EOS>
To lay one in, another out to have. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now <EOS>
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow; <EOS>
The other did not so. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
O, she knew well <EOS>
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell. <EOS>
But come, young waverer, come, go with me, <EOS>
In one respect I'll thy assistant be; <EOS>
For this alliance may so happy prove, <EOS>
To turn your households' rancour to pure love. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Where the devil should this Romeo be? <EOS>
Came he not home to-night? <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. <EOS>
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, <EOS>
Hath sent a letter to his father's house. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
A challenge, on my life. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Romeo will answer it. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Any man that can write may answer a letter. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he <EOS>
dares, being dared. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a <EOS>
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a <EOS>
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the <EOS>
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to <EOS>
encounter Tybalt? <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Why, what is Tybalt? <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is <EOS>
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as <EOS>
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and <EOS>
proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and <EOS>
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk <EOS>
button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the <EOS>
very first house, of the first and second cause: <EOS>
ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the <EOS>
hai! <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
The what? <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting <EOS>
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu, <EOS>
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good <EOS>
whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing, <EOS>
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with <EOS>
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these <EOS>
perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form, <EOS>
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their <EOS>
bones, their bones! <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh, <EOS>
how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers <EOS>
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a <EOS>
kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to <EOS>
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy; <EOS>
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey <EOS>
eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior <EOS>
Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation <EOS>
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit <EOS>
fairly last night. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you? <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in <EOS>
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours <EOS>
constrains a man to bow in the hams. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Meaning, to court'sy. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Thou hast most kindly hit it. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
A most courteous exposition. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Pink for flower. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Right. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Why, then is my pump well flowered. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast <EOS>
worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it <EOS>
is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
O single-soled jest, solely singular for the <EOS>
singleness. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have <EOS>
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of <EOS>
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five: <EOS>
was I with you there for the goose? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast <EOS>
not there for the goose. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Nay, good goose, bite not. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most <EOS>
sharp sauce. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
And is it not well served in to a sweet goose? <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an <EOS>
inch narrow to an ell broad! <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added <EOS>
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? <EOS>
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art <EOS>
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature: <EOS>
for this drivelling love is like a great natural, <EOS>
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Stop there, stop there. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short: <EOS>
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and <EOS>
meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Here's goodly gear! <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
A sail, a sail! <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Two, two; a shirt and a smock. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Peter! <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
Anon! <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
My fan, Peter. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the <EOS>
fairer face. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
God ye good morrow, gentlemen. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Is it good den? <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the <EOS>
dial is now upon the prick of noon. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Out upon you! what a man are you! <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to <EOS>
mar. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,' <EOS>
quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I <EOS>
may find the young Romeo? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when <EOS>
you have found him than he was when you sought him: <EOS>
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
You say well. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith; <EOS>
wisely, wisely. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with <EOS>
you. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
She will indite him to some supper. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho! <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
What hast thou found? <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, <EOS>
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent. <EOS>
An old hare hoar, <EOS>
And an old hare hoar, <EOS>
Is very good meat in lent <EOS>
But a hare that is hoar <EOS>
Is too much for a score, <EOS>
When it hoars ere it be spent. <EOS>
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll <EOS>
to dinner, thither. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I will follow you. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, <EOS>
'lady, lady, lady.' <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy <EOS>
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, <EOS>
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand <EOS>
to in a month. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him <EOS>
down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such <EOS>
Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall. <EOS>
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am <EOS>
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by <EOS>
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure? <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon <EOS>
should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare <EOS>
draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a <EOS>
good quarrel, and the law on my side. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about <EOS>
me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word: <EOS>
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you <EOS>
out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself: <EOS>
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into <EOS>
a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross <EOS>
kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman <EOS>
is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double <EOS>
with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered <EOS>
to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I <EOS>
protest unto thee-- <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much: <EOS>
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as <EOS>
I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Bid her devise <EOS>
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon; <EOS>
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell <EOS>
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
No truly sir; not a penny. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Go to; I say you shall. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall: <EOS>
Within this hour my man shall be with thee <EOS>
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair; <EOS>
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy <EOS>
Must be my convoy in the secret night. <EOS>
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains: <EOS>
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
What say'st thou, my dear nurse? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say, <EOS>
Two may keep counsel, putting one away? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel. <EOS>
NURSE: <EOS>
Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord, <EOS>
Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there <EOS>
is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain <EOS>
lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief <EOS>
see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her <EOS>
sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer <EOS>
man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks <EOS>
as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not <EOS>
rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for <EOS>
the--No; I know it begins with some other <EOS>
letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of <EOS>
it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good <EOS>
to hear it. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Commend me to thy lady. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Ay, a thousand times. <EOS>
Peter! <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
Anon! <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse; <EOS>
In half an hour she promised to return. <EOS>
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so. <EOS>
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts, <EOS>
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams, <EOS>
Driving back shadows over louring hills: <EOS>
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love, <EOS>
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. <EOS>
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill <EOS>
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve <EOS>
Is three long hours, yet she is not come. <EOS>
Had she affections and warm youthful blood, <EOS>
She would be as swift in motion as a ball; <EOS>
My words would bandy her to my sweet love, <EOS>
And his to me: <EOS>
But old folks, many feign as they were dead; <EOS>
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. <EOS>
O God, she comes! <EOS>
O honey nurse, what news? <EOS>
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Peter, stay at the gate. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad? <EOS>
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily; <EOS>
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news <EOS>
By playing it to me with so sour a face. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: <EOS>
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: <EOS>
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile? <EOS>
Do you not see that I am out of breath? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath <EOS>
To say to me that thou art out of breath? <EOS>
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay <EOS>
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. <EOS>
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that; <EOS>
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance: <EOS>
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not <EOS>
how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his <EOS>
face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels <EOS>
all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body, <EOS>
though they be not to be talked on, yet they are <EOS>
past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy, <EOS>
but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy <EOS>
ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
No, no: but all this did I know before. <EOS>
What says he of our marriage? what of that? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! <EOS>
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces. <EOS>
My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back! <EOS>
Beshrew your heart for sending me about, <EOS>
To catch my death with jaunting up and down! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. <EOS>
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a <EOS>
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I <EOS>
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Where is my mother! why, she is within; <EOS>
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest! <EOS>
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman, <EOS>
Where is your mother?' <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
O God's lady dear! <EOS>
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow; <EOS>
Is this the poultice for my aching bones? <EOS>
Henceforward do your messages yourself. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I have. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell; <EOS>
There stays a husband to make you a wife: <EOS>
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks, <EOS>
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news. <EOS>
Hie you to church; I must another way, <EOS>
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love <EOS>
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark: <EOS>
I am the drudge and toil in your delight, <EOS>
But you shall bear the burden soon at night. <EOS>
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
So smile the heavens upon this holy act, <EOS>
That after hours with sorrow chide us not! <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can, <EOS>
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy <EOS>
That one short minute gives me in her sight: <EOS>
Do thou but close our hands with holy words, <EOS>
Then love-devouring death do what he dare; <EOS>
It is enough I may but call her mine. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
These violent delights have violent ends <EOS>
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, <EOS>
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey <EOS>
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness <EOS>
And in the taste confounds the appetite: <EOS>
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so; <EOS>
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. <EOS>
Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot <EOS>
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint: <EOS>
A lover may bestride the gossamer <EOS>
That idles in the wanton summer air, <EOS>
And yet not fall; so light is vanity. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Good even to my ghostly confessor. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
As much to him, else is his thanks too much. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy <EOS>
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more <EOS>
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath <EOS>
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue <EOS>
Unfold the imagined happiness that both <EOS>
Receive in either by this dear encounter. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words, <EOS>
Brags of his substance, not of ornament: <EOS>
They are but beggars that can count their worth; <EOS>
But my true love is grown to such excess <EOS>
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Come, come with me, and we will make short work; <EOS>
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone <EOS>
Till holy church incorporate two in one. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire: <EOS>
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad, <EOS>
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl; <EOS>
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he <EOS>
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword <EOS>
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of <EOS>
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws <EOS>
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Am I like such a fellow? <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as <EOS>
any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as <EOS>
soon moody to be moved. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
And what to? <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none <EOS>
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why, <EOS>
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more, <EOS>
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou <EOS>
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no <EOS>
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what <EOS>
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? <EOS>
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of <EOS>
meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as <EOS>
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a <EOS>
man for coughing in the street, because he hath <EOS>
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun: <EOS>
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing <EOS>
his new doublet before Easter? with another, for <EOS>
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou <EOS>
wilt tutor me from quarrelling! <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man <EOS>
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
The fee-simple! O simple! <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
By my head, here come the Capulets. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
By my heel, I care not. <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
Follow me close, for I will speak to them. <EOS>
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
And but one word with one of us? couple it with <EOS>
something; make it a word and a blow. <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you <EOS>
will give me occasion. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Could you not take some occasion without giving? <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,-- <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an <EOS>
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but <EOS>
discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall <EOS>
make you dance. 'Zounds, consort! <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
We talk here in the public haunt of men: <EOS>
Either withdraw unto some private place, <EOS>
And reason coldly of your grievances, <EOS>
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze; <EOS>
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I. <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery: <EOS>
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower; <EOS>
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.' <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford <EOS>
No better term than this,--thou art a villain. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee <EOS>
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage <EOS>
To such a greeting: villain am I none; <EOS>
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not. <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries <EOS>
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I do protest, I never injured thee, <EOS>
But love thee better than thou canst devise, <EOS>
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love: <EOS>
And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender <EOS>
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission! <EOS>
Alla stoccata carries it away. <EOS>
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk? <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
What wouldst thou have with me? <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine <EOS>
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you <EOS>
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the <EOS>
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher <EOS>
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your <EOS>
ears ere it be out. <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
I am for you. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Come, sir, your passado. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons. <EOS>
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage! <EOS>
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath <EOS>
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets: <EOS>
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio! <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
I am hurt. <EOS>
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped. <EOS>
Is he gone, and hath nothing? <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
What, art thou hurt? <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough. <EOS>
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a <EOS>
church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for <EOS>
me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I <EOS>
am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o' <EOS>
both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a <EOS>
cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a <EOS>
rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of <EOS>
arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I <EOS>
was hurt under your arm. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I thought all for the best. <EOS>
MERCUTIO: <EOS>
Help me into some house, Benvolio, <EOS>
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses! <EOS>
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it, <EOS>
And soundly too: your houses! <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
This gentleman, the prince's near ally, <EOS>
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt <EOS>
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd <EOS>
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour <EOS>
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet, <EOS>
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate <EOS>
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel! <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead! <EOS>
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds, <EOS>
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
This day's black fate on more days doth depend; <EOS>
This but begins the woe, others must end. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain! <EOS>
Away to heaven, respective lenity, <EOS>
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now! <EOS>
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again, <EOS>
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul <EOS>
Is but a little way above our heads, <EOS>
Staying for thine to keep him company: <EOS>
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him. <EOS>
TYBALT: <EOS>
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here, <EOS>
Shalt with him hence. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
This shall determine that. <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Romeo, away, be gone! <EOS>
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain. <EOS>
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death, <EOS>
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away! <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
O, I am fortune's fool! <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Why dost thou stay? <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio? <EOS>
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he? <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
There lies that Tybalt. <EOS>
First Citizen: <EOS>
Up, sir, go with me; <EOS>
I charge thee in the princes name, obey. <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
Where are the vile beginners of this fray? <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
O noble prince, I can discover all <EOS>
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl: <EOS>
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, <EOS>
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child! <EOS>
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt <EOS>
O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true, <EOS>
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague. <EOS>
O cousin, cousin! <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? <EOS>
BENVOLIO: <EOS>
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay; <EOS>
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink <EOS>
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal <EOS>
Your high displeasure: all this uttered <EOS>
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd, <EOS>
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen <EOS>
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts <EOS>
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast, <EOS>
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point, <EOS>
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats <EOS>
Cold death aside, and with the other sends <EOS>
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity, <EOS>
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud, <EOS>
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than <EOS>
his tongue, <EOS>
His agile arm beats down their fatal points, <EOS>
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm <EOS>
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life <EOS>
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled; <EOS>
But by and by comes back to Romeo, <EOS>
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge, <EOS>
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I <EOS>
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain. <EOS>
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly. <EOS>
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
He is a kinsman to the Montague; <EOS>
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true: <EOS>
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, <EOS>
And all those twenty could but kill one life. <EOS>
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give; <EOS>
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live. <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio; <EOS>
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend; <EOS>
His fault concludes but what the law should end, <EOS>
The life of Tybalt. <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
And for that offence <EOS>
Immediately we do exile him hence: <EOS>
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding, <EOS>
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding; <EOS>
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine <EOS>
That you shall all repent the loss of mine: <EOS>
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses; <EOS>
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses: <EOS>
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste, <EOS>
Else, when he's found, that hour is his last. <EOS>
Bear hence this body and attend our will: <EOS>
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, <EOS>
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner <EOS>
As Phaethon would whip you to the west, <EOS>
And bring in cloudy night immediately. <EOS>
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, <EOS>
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo <EOS>
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen. <EOS>
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites <EOS>
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind, <EOS>
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night, <EOS>
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, <EOS>
And learn me how to lose a winning match, <EOS>
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods: <EOS>
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks, <EOS>
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold, <EOS>
Think true love acted simple modesty. <EOS>
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night; <EOS>
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night <EOS>
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back. <EOS>
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night, <EOS>
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die, <EOS>
Take him and cut him out in little stars, <EOS>
And he will make the face of heaven so fine <EOS>
That all the world will be in love with night <EOS>
And pay no worship to the garish sun. <EOS>
O, I have bought the mansion of a love, <EOS>
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold, <EOS>
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day <EOS>
As is the night before some festival <EOS>
To an impatient child that hath new robes <EOS>
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse, <EOS>
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks <EOS>
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence. <EOS>
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords <EOS>
That Romeo bid thee fetch? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Ay, ay, the cords. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead! <EOS>
We are undone, lady, we are undone! <EOS>
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Can heaven be so envious? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Romeo can, <EOS>
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo! <EOS>
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus? <EOS>
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell. <EOS>
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,' <EOS>
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more <EOS>
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice: <EOS>
I am not I, if there be such an I; <EOS>
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.' <EOS>
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no: <EOS>
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,-- <EOS>
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast: <EOS>
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse; <EOS>
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood, <EOS>
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once! <EOS>
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty! <EOS>
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here; <EOS>
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier! <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had! <EOS>
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman! <EOS>
That ever I should live to see thee dead! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
What storm is this that blows so contrary? <EOS>
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead? <EOS>
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord? <EOS>
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom! <EOS>
For who is living, if those two are gone? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished; <EOS>
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
It did, it did; alas the day, it did! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face! <EOS>
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? <EOS>
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! <EOS>
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! <EOS>
Despised substance of divinest show! <EOS>
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st, <EOS>
A damned saint, an honourable villain! <EOS>
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell, <EOS>
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend <EOS>
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh? <EOS>
Was ever book containing such vile matter <EOS>
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell <EOS>
In such a gorgeous palace! <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
There's no trust, <EOS>
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured, <EOS>
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. <EOS>
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae: <EOS>
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old. <EOS>
Shame come to Romeo! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Blister'd be thy tongue <EOS>
For such a wish! he was not born to shame: <EOS>
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit; <EOS>
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd <EOS>
Sole monarch of the universal earth. <EOS>
O, what a beast was I to chide at him! <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband? <EOS>
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name, <EOS>
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it? <EOS>
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? <EOS>
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband: <EOS>
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring; <EOS>
Your tributary drops belong to woe, <EOS>
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy. <EOS>
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain; <EOS>
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband: <EOS>
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then? <EOS>
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death, <EOS>
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain; <EOS>
But, O, it presses to my memory, <EOS>
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds: <EOS>
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;' <EOS>
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,' <EOS>
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death <EOS>
Was woe enough, if it had ended there: <EOS>
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship <EOS>
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs, <EOS>
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,' <EOS>
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both, <EOS>
Which modern lamentations might have moved? <EOS>
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death, <EOS>
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word, <EOS>
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, <EOS>
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!' <EOS>
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, <EOS>
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound. <EOS>
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse: <EOS>
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent, <EOS>
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment. <EOS>
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled, <EOS>
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled: <EOS>
He made you for a highway to my bed; <EOS>
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed. <EOS>
Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed; <EOS>
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead! <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo <EOS>
To comfort you: I wot well where he is. <EOS>
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night: <EOS>
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
O, find him! give this ring to my true knight, <EOS>
And bid him come to take his last farewell. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man: <EOS>
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts, <EOS>
And thou art wedded to calamity. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Father, what news? what is the prince's doom? <EOS>
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand, <EOS>
That I yet know not? <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Too familiar <EOS>
Is my dear son with such sour company: <EOS>
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom? <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips, <EOS>
Not body's death, but body's banishment. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;' <EOS>
For exile hath more terror in his look, <EOS>
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.' <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Hence from Verona art thou banished: <EOS>
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
There is no world without Verona walls, <EOS>
But purgatory, torture, hell itself. <EOS>
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world, <EOS>
And world's exile is death: then banished, <EOS>
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment, <EOS>
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe, <EOS>
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness! <EOS>
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince, <EOS>
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law, <EOS>
And turn'd that black word death to banishment: <EOS>
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here, <EOS>
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog <EOS>
And little mouse, every unworthy thing, <EOS>
Live here in heaven and may look on her; <EOS>
But Romeo may not: more validity, <EOS>
More honourable state, more courtship lives <EOS>
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize <EOS>
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand <EOS>
And steal immortal blessing from her lips, <EOS>
Who even in pure and vestal modesty, <EOS>
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin; <EOS>
But Romeo may not; he is banished: <EOS>
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly: <EOS>
They are free men, but I am banished. <EOS>
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death? <EOS>
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife, <EOS>
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, <EOS>
But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'? <EOS>
O friar, the damned use that word in hell; <EOS>
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart, <EOS>
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, <EOS>
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd, <EOS>
To mangle me with that word 'banished'? <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word: <EOS>
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy, <EOS>
To comfort thee, though thou art banished. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy! <EOS>
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet, <EOS>
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom, <EOS>
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
O, then I see that madmen have no ears. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes? <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel: <EOS>
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, <EOS>
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered, <EOS>
Doting like me and like me banished, <EOS>
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, <EOS>
And fall upon the ground, as I do now, <EOS>
Taking the measure of an unmade grave. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans, <EOS>
Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise; <EOS>
Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up; <EOS>
Run to my study. By and by! God's will, <EOS>
What simpleness is this! I come, I come! <EOS>
Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Welcome, then. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar, <EOS>
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo? <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
O, he is even in my mistress' case, <EOS>
Just in her case! O woful sympathy! <EOS>
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she, <EOS>
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering. <EOS>
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man: <EOS>
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand; <EOS>
Why should you fall into so deep an O? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Nurse! <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her? <EOS>
Doth she not think me an old murderer, <EOS>
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy <EOS>
With blood removed but little from her own? <EOS>
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says <EOS>
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps; <EOS>
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up, <EOS>
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries, <EOS>
And then down falls again. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
As if that name, <EOS>
Shot from the deadly level of a gun, <EOS>
Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand <EOS>
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me, <EOS>
In what vile part of this anatomy <EOS>
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack <EOS>
The hateful mansion. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Hold thy desperate hand: <EOS>
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art: <EOS>
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote <EOS>
The unreasonable fury of a beast: <EOS>
Unseemly woman in a seeming man! <EOS>
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both! <EOS>
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order, <EOS>
I thought thy disposition better temper'd. <EOS>
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself? <EOS>
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee, <EOS>
By doing damned hate upon thyself? <EOS>
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? <EOS>
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet <EOS>
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose. <EOS>
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit; <EOS>
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all, <EOS>
And usest none in that true use indeed <EOS>
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit: <EOS>
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax, <EOS>
Digressing from the valour of a man; <EOS>
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, <EOS>
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish; <EOS>
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, <EOS>
Misshapen in the conduct of them both, <EOS>
Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask, <EOS>
Is set afire by thine own ignorance, <EOS>
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence. <EOS>
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive, <EOS>
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead; <EOS>
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee, <EOS>
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too: <EOS>
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend <EOS>
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy: <EOS>
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back; <EOS>
Happiness courts thee in her best array; <EOS>
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench, <EOS>
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love: <EOS>
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable. <EOS>
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed, <EOS>
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her: <EOS>
But look thou stay not till the watch be set, <EOS>
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua; <EOS>
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time <EOS>
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, <EOS>
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back <EOS>
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy <EOS>
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation. <EOS>
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady; <EOS>
And bid her hasten all the house to bed, <EOS>
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto: <EOS>
Romeo is coming. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night <EOS>
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is! <EOS>
My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir: <EOS>
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
How well my comfort is revived by this! <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state: <EOS>
Either be gone before the watch be set, <EOS>
Or by the break of day disguised from hence: <EOS>
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man, <EOS>
And he shall signify from time to time <EOS>
Every good hap to you that chances here: <EOS>
Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
But that a joy past joy calls out on me, <EOS>
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily, <EOS>
That we have had no time to move our daughter: <EOS>
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly, <EOS>
And so did I:--Well, we were born to die. <EOS>
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night: <EOS>
I promise you, but for your company, <EOS>
I would have been a-bed an hour ago. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
These times of woe afford no time to woo. <EOS>
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
I will, and know her mind early to-morrow; <EOS>
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender <EOS>
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled <EOS>
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not. <EOS>
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed; <EOS>
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love; <EOS>
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next-- <EOS>
But, soft! what day is this? <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
Monday, my lord, <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon, <EOS>
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her, <EOS>
She shall be married to this noble earl. <EOS>
Will you be ready? do you like this haste? <EOS>
We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two; <EOS>
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, <EOS>
It may be thought we held him carelessly, <EOS>
Being our kinsman, if we revel much: <EOS>
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends, <EOS>
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday? <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then. <EOS>
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed, <EOS>
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day. <EOS>
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho! <EOS>
Afore me! it is so very very late, <EOS>
That we may call it early by and by. <EOS>
Good night. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day: <EOS>
It was the nightingale, and not the lark, <EOS>
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear; <EOS>
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree: <EOS>
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
It was the lark, the herald of the morn, <EOS>
No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks <EOS>
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east: <EOS>
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day <EOS>
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. <EOS>
I must be gone and live, or stay and die. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I: <EOS>
It is some meteor that the sun exhales, <EOS>
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer, <EOS>
And light thee on thy way to Mantua: <EOS>
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death; <EOS>
I am content, so thou wilt have it so. <EOS>
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye, <EOS>
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow; <EOS>
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat <EOS>
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads: <EOS>
I have more care to stay than will to go: <EOS>
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so. <EOS>
How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away! <EOS>
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, <EOS>
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. <EOS>
Some say the lark makes sweet division; <EOS>
This doth not so, for she divideth us: <EOS>
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes, <EOS>
O, now I would they had changed voices too! <EOS>
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, <EOS>
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day, <EOS>
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
More light and light; more dark and dark our woes! <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Madam! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Nurse? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber: <EOS>
The day is broke; be wary, look about. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Then, window, let day in, and let life out. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend! <EOS>
I must hear from thee every day in the hour, <EOS>
For in a minute there are many days: <EOS>
O, by this count I shall be much in years <EOS>
Ere I again behold my Romeo! <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Farewell! <EOS>
I will omit no opportunity <EOS>
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
O think'st thou we shall ever meet again? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve <EOS>
For sweet discourses in our time to come. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
O God, I have an ill-divining soul! <EOS>
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below, <EOS>
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb: <EOS>
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you: <EOS>
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle: <EOS>
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him. <EOS>
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune; <EOS>
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long, <EOS>
But send him back. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother? <EOS>
Is she not down so late, or up so early? <EOS>
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither? <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Why, how now, Juliet! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Madam, I am not well. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death? <EOS>
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? <EOS>
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live; <EOS>
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love; <EOS>
But much of grief shows still some want of wit. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend <EOS>
Which you weep for. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Feeling so the loss, <EOS>
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death, <EOS>
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
What villain madam? <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
That same villain, Romeo. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
That is, because the traitor murderer lives. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands: <EOS>
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death! <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not: <EOS>
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua, <EOS>
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live, <EOS>
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram, <EOS>
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company: <EOS>
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied <EOS>
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead-- <EOS>
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd. <EOS>
Madam, if you could find out but a man <EOS>
To bear a poison, I would temper it; <EOS>
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, <EOS>
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors <EOS>
To hear him named, and cannot come to him. <EOS>
To wreak the love I bore my cousin <EOS>
Upon his body that slaughter'd him! <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man. <EOS>
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
And joy comes well in such a needy time: <EOS>
What are they, I beseech your ladyship? <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; <EOS>
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, <EOS>
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy, <EOS>
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Madam, in happy time, what day is that? <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn, <EOS>
The gallant, young and noble gentleman, <EOS>
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, <EOS>
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too, <EOS>
He shall not make me there a joyful bride. <EOS>
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed <EOS>
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo. <EOS>
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam, <EOS>
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear, <EOS>
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, <EOS>
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed! <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Here comes your father; tell him so yourself, <EOS>
And see how he will take it at your hands. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew; <EOS>
But for the sunset of my brother's son <EOS>
It rains downright. <EOS>
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears? <EOS>
Evermore showering? In one little body <EOS>
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind; <EOS>
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, <EOS>
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is, <EOS>
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs; <EOS>
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them, <EOS>
Without a sudden calm, will overset <EOS>
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife! <EOS>
Have you deliver'd to her our decree? <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks. <EOS>
I would the fool were married to her grave! <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife. <EOS>
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks? <EOS>
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest, <EOS>
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought <EOS>
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have: <EOS>
Proud can I never be of what I hate; <EOS>
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this? <EOS>
'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;' <EOS>
And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you, <EOS>
Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds, <EOS>
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next, <EOS>
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church, <EOS>
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither. <EOS>
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage! <EOS>
You tallow-face! <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Fie, fie! what, are you mad? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Good father, I beseech you on my knees, <EOS>
Hear me with patience but to speak a word. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch! <EOS>
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday, <EOS>
Or never after look me in the face: <EOS>
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me; <EOS>
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest <EOS>
That God had lent us but this only child; <EOS>
But now I see this one is one too much, <EOS>
And that we have a curse in having her: <EOS>
Out on her, hilding! <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
God in heaven bless her! <EOS>
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue, <EOS>
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
I speak no treason. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
O, God ye god-den. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
May not one speak? <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Peace, you mumbling fool! <EOS>
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl; <EOS>
For here we need it not. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
You are too hot. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
God's bread! it makes me mad: <EOS>
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, <EOS>
Alone, in company, still my care hath been <EOS>
To have her match'd: and having now provided <EOS>
A gentleman of noble parentage, <EOS>
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd, <EOS>
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts, <EOS>
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man; <EOS>
And then to have a wretched puling fool, <EOS>
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender, <EOS>
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love, <EOS>
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.' <EOS>
But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you: <EOS>
Graze where you will you shall not house with me: <EOS>
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest. <EOS>
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise: <EOS>
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend; <EOS>
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in <EOS>
the streets, <EOS>
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee, <EOS>
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good: <EOS>
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds, <EOS>
That sees into the bottom of my grief? <EOS>
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away! <EOS>
Delay this marriage for a month, a week; <EOS>
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed <EOS>
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word: <EOS>
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented? <EOS>
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven; <EOS>
How shall that faith return again to earth, <EOS>
Unless that husband send it me from heaven <EOS>
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me. <EOS>
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems <EOS>
Upon so soft a subject as myself! <EOS>
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy? <EOS>
Some comfort, nurse. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Faith, here it is. <EOS>
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing, <EOS>
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you; <EOS>
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth. <EOS>
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, <EOS>
I think it best you married with the county. <EOS>
O, he's a lovely gentleman! <EOS>
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam, <EOS>
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye <EOS>
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, <EOS>
I think you are happy in this second match, <EOS>
For it excels your first: or if it did not, <EOS>
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were, <EOS>
As living here and you no use of him. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Speakest thou from thy heart? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
And from my soul too; <EOS>
Or else beshrew them both. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Amen! <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
What? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much. <EOS>
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone, <EOS>
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell, <EOS>
To make confession and to be absolved. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend! <EOS>
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn, <EOS>
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue <EOS>
Which she hath praised him with above compare <EOS>
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor; <EOS>
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain. <EOS>
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy: <EOS>
If all else fail, myself have power to die. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
On Thursday, sir? the time is very short. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
My father Capulet will have it so; <EOS>
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
You say you do not know the lady's mind: <EOS>
Uneven is the course, I like it not. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death, <EOS>
And therefore have I little talk'd of love; <EOS>
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. <EOS>
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous <EOS>
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway, <EOS>
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage, <EOS>
To stop the inundation of her tears; <EOS>
Which, too much minded by herself alone, <EOS>
May be put from her by society: <EOS>
Now do you know the reason of this haste. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
Happily met, my lady and my wife! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
What must be shall be. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
That's a certain text. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
Come you to make confession to this father? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
To answer that, I should confess to you. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
Do not deny to him that you love me. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I will confess to you that I love him. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
If I do so, it will be of more price, <EOS>
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
The tears have got small victory by that; <EOS>
For it was bad enough before their spite. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth; <EOS>
And what I spake, I spake it to my face. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
It may be so, for it is not mine own. <EOS>
Are you at leisure, holy father, now; <EOS>
Or shall I come to you at evening mass? <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now. <EOS>
My lord, we must entreat the time alone. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
God shield I should disturb devotion! <EOS>
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye: <EOS>
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
O shut the door! and when thou hast done so, <EOS>
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help! <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief; <EOS>
It strains me past the compass of my wits: <EOS>
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, <EOS>
On Thursday next be married to this county. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this, <EOS>
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it: <EOS>
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, <EOS>
Do thou but call my resolution wise, <EOS>
And with this knife I'll help it presently. <EOS>
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands; <EOS>
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd, <EOS>
Shall be the label to another deed, <EOS>
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt <EOS>
Turn to another, this shall slay them both: <EOS>
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time, <EOS>
Give me some present counsel, or, behold, <EOS>
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife <EOS>
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that <EOS>
Which the commission of thy years and art <EOS>
Could to no issue of true honour bring. <EOS>
Be not so long to speak; I long to die, <EOS>
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope, <EOS>
Which craves as desperate an execution. <EOS>
As that is desperate which we would prevent. <EOS>
If, rather than to marry County Paris, <EOS>
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, <EOS>
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake <EOS>
A thing like death to chide away this shame, <EOS>
That copest with death himself to scape from it: <EOS>
And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, <EOS>
From off the battlements of yonder tower; <EOS>
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk <EOS>
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears; <EOS>
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house, <EOS>
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones, <EOS>
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls; <EOS>
Or bid me go into a new-made grave <EOS>
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud; <EOS>
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble; <EOS>
And I will do it without fear or doubt, <EOS>
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent <EOS>
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow: <EOS>
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone; <EOS>
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber: <EOS>
Take thou this vial, being then in bed, <EOS>
And this distilled liquor drink thou off; <EOS>
When presently through all thy veins shall run <EOS>
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse <EOS>
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease: <EOS>
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest; <EOS>
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade <EOS>
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall, <EOS>
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life; <EOS>
Each part, deprived of supple government, <EOS>
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death: <EOS>
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death <EOS>
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours, <EOS>
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. <EOS>
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes <EOS>
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead: <EOS>
Then, as the manner of our country is, <EOS>
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier <EOS>
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault <EOS>
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. <EOS>
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, <EOS>
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, <EOS>
And hither shall he come: and he and I <EOS>
Will watch thy waking, and that very night <EOS>
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. <EOS>
And this shall free thee from this present shame; <EOS>
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear, <EOS>
Abate thy valour in the acting it. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear! <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous <EOS>
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed <EOS>
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford. <EOS>
Farewell, dear father! <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
So many guests invite as here are writ. <EOS>
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks. <EOS>
Second Servant: <EOS>
You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they <EOS>
can lick their fingers. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
How canst thou try them so? <EOS>
Second Servant: <EOS>
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his <EOS>
own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his <EOS>
fingers goes not with me. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Go, be gone. <EOS>
We shall be much unfurnished for this time. <EOS>
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Ay, forsooth. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Well, he may chance to do some good on her: <EOS>
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
See where she comes from shrift with merry look. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin <EOS>
Of disobedient opposition <EOS>
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd <EOS>
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here, <EOS>
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you! <EOS>
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Send for the county; go tell him of this: <EOS>
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell; <EOS>
And gave him what becomed love I might, <EOS>
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up: <EOS>
This is as't should be. Let me see the county; <EOS>
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither. <EOS>
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar, <EOS>
Our whole city is much bound to him. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet, <EOS>
To help me sort such needful ornaments <EOS>
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow? <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
No, not till Thursday; there is time enough. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow. <EOS>
LADY  CAPULET: <EOS>
We shall be short in our provision: <EOS>
'Tis now near night. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Tush, I will stir about, <EOS>
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife: <EOS>
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her; <EOS>
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone; <EOS>
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho! <EOS>
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself <EOS>
To County Paris, to prepare him up <EOS>
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light, <EOS>
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse, <EOS>
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night, <EOS>
For I have need of many orisons <EOS>
To move the heavens to smile upon my state, <EOS>
Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
What, are you busy, ho? need you my help? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries <EOS>
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow: <EOS>
So please you, let me now be left alone, <EOS>
And let the nurse this night sit up with you; <EOS>
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all, <EOS>
In this so sudden business. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Good night: <EOS>
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again. <EOS>
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins, <EOS>
That almost freezes up the heat of life: <EOS>
I'll call them back again to comfort me: <EOS>
Nurse! What should she do here? <EOS>
My dismal scene I needs must act alone. <EOS>
Come, vial. <EOS>
What if this mixture do not work at all? <EOS>
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning? <EOS>
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there. <EOS>
What if it be a poison, which the friar <EOS>
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead, <EOS>
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd, <EOS>
Because he married me before to Romeo? <EOS>
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not, <EOS>
For he hath still been tried a holy man. <EOS>
How if, when I am laid into the tomb, <EOS>
I wake before the time that Romeo <EOS>
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point! <EOS>
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault, <EOS>
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, <EOS>
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes? <EOS>
Or, if I live, is it not very like, <EOS>
The horrible conceit of death and night, <EOS>
Together with the terror of the place,-- <EOS>
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle, <EOS>
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones <EOS>
Of all my buried ancestors are packed: <EOS>
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, <EOS>
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say, <EOS>
At some hours in the night spirits resort;-- <EOS>
Alack, alack, is it not like that I, <EOS>
So early waking, what with loathsome smells, <EOS>
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth, <EOS>
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:-- <EOS>
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught, <EOS>
Environed with all these hideous fears? <EOS>
And madly play with my forefather's joints? <EOS>
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud? <EOS>
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone, <EOS>
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains? <EOS>
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost <EOS>
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body <EOS>
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay! <EOS>
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd, <EOS>
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock: <EOS>
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica: <EOS>
Spare not for the cost. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Go, you cot-quean, go, <EOS>
Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow <EOS>
For this night's watching. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now <EOS>
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick. <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time; <EOS>
But I will watch you from such watching now. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
A jealous hood, a jealous hood! <EOS>
Now, fellow, <EOS>
What's there? <EOS>
First Servant: <EOS>
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Make haste, make haste. <EOS>
Sirrah, fetch drier logs: <EOS>
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are. <EOS>
Second Servant: <EOS>
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs, <EOS>
And never trouble Peter for the matter. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha! <EOS>
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day: <EOS>
The county will be here with music straight, <EOS>
For so he said he would: I hear him near. <EOS>
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say! <EOS>
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up; <EOS>
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste, <EOS>
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already: <EOS>
Make haste, I say. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she: <EOS>
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed! <EOS>
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride! <EOS>
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now; <EOS>
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant, <EOS>
The County Paris hath set up his rest, <EOS>
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me, <EOS>
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep! <EOS>
I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam! <EOS>
Ay, let the county take you in your bed; <EOS>
He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be? <EOS>
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again! <EOS>
I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady! <EOS>
Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead! <EOS>
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born! <EOS>
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady! <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
What noise is here? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
O lamentable day! <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
What is the matter? <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Look, look! O heavy day! <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
O me, O me! My child, my only life, <EOS>
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee! <EOS>
Help, help! Call help. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day! <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead! <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold: <EOS>
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff; <EOS>
Life and these lips have long been separated: <EOS>
Death lies on her like an untimely frost <EOS>
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
O lamentable day! <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
O woful time! <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail, <EOS>
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Come, is the bride ready to go to church? <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Ready to go, but never to return. <EOS>
O son! the night before thy wedding-day <EOS>
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies, <EOS>
Flower as she was, deflowered by him. <EOS>
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir; <EOS>
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die, <EOS>
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
Have I thought long to see this morning's face, <EOS>
And doth it give me such a sight as this? <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day! <EOS>
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw <EOS>
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage! <EOS>
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, <EOS>
But one thing to rejoice and solace in, <EOS>
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight! <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
O woe! O woful, woful, woful day! <EOS>
Most lamentable day, most woful day, <EOS>
That ever, ever, I did yet behold! <EOS>
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day! <EOS>
Never was seen so black a day as this: <EOS>
O woful day, O woful day! <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain! <EOS>
Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd, <EOS>
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown! <EOS>
O love! O life! not life, but love in death! <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd! <EOS>
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now <EOS>
To murder, murder our solemnity? <EOS>
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child! <EOS>
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead; <EOS>
And with my child my joys are buried. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not <EOS>
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself <EOS>
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all, <EOS>
And all the better is it for the maid: <EOS>
Your part in her you could not keep from death, <EOS>
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life. <EOS>
The most you sought was her promotion; <EOS>
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced: <EOS>
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced <EOS>
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? <EOS>
O, in this love, you love your child so ill, <EOS>
That you run mad, seeing that she is well: <EOS>
She's not well married that lives married long; <EOS>
But she's best married that dies married young. <EOS>
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary <EOS>
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is, <EOS>
In all her best array bear her to church: <EOS>
For though fond nature bids us an lament, <EOS>
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
All things that we ordained festival, <EOS>
Turn from their office to black funeral; <EOS>
Our instruments to melancholy bells, <EOS>
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast, <EOS>
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change, <EOS>
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse, <EOS>
And all things change them to the contrary. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him; <EOS>
And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare <EOS>
To follow this fair corse unto her grave: <EOS>
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill; <EOS>
Move them no more by crossing their high will. <EOS>
First Musician: <EOS>
Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone. <EOS>
Nurse: <EOS>
Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up; <EOS>
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case. <EOS>
First Musician: <EOS>
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended. <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's <EOS>
ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.' <EOS>
First Musician: <EOS>
Why 'Heart's ease?' <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My <EOS>
heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump, <EOS>
to comfort me. <EOS>
First Musician: <EOS>
Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now. <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
You will not, then? <EOS>
First Musician: <EOS>
No. <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
I will then give it you soundly. <EOS>
First Musician: <EOS>
What will you give us? <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
No money, on my faith, but the gleek; <EOS>
I will give you the minstrel. <EOS>
First Musician: <EOS>
Then I will give you the serving-creature. <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on <EOS>
your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you, <EOS>
I'll fa you; do you note me? <EOS>
First Musician: <EOS>
An you re us and fa us, you note us. <EOS>
Second Musician: <EOS>
Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit. <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you <EOS>
with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer <EOS>
me like men: <EOS>
'When griping grief the heart doth wound, <EOS>
And doleful dumps the mind oppress, <EOS>
Then music with her silver sound'-- <EOS>
why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver <EOS>
sound'? What say you, Simon Catling? <EOS>
Musician: <EOS>
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound. <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck? <EOS>
Second Musician: <EOS>
I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver. <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost? <EOS>
Third Musician: <EOS>
Faith, I know not what to say. <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say <EOS>
for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,' <EOS>
because musicians have no gold for sounding: <EOS>
'Then music with her silver sound <EOS>
With speedy help doth lend redress.' <EOS>
First Musician: <EOS>
What a pestilent knave is this same! <EOS>
Second Musician: <EOS>
Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the <EOS>
mourners, and stay dinner. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep, <EOS>
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand: <EOS>
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne; <EOS>
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit <EOS>
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. <EOS>
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead-- <EOS>
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave <EOS>
to think!-- <EOS>
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips, <EOS>
That I revived, and was an emperor. <EOS>
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd, <EOS>
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy! <EOS>
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar! <EOS>
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar? <EOS>
How doth my lady? Is my father well? <EOS>
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again; <EOS>
For nothing can be ill, if she be well. <EOS>
BALTHASAR: <EOS>
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill: <EOS>
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument, <EOS>
And her immortal part with angels lives. <EOS>
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault, <EOS>
And presently took post to tell it you: <EOS>
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news, <EOS>
Since you did leave it for my office, sir. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars! <EOS>
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper, <EOS>
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night. <EOS>
BALTHASAR: <EOS>
I do beseech you, sir, have patience: <EOS>
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import <EOS>
Some misadventure. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Tush, thou art deceived: <EOS>
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do. <EOS>
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar? <EOS>
BALTHASAR: <EOS>
No, my good lord. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
No matter: get thee gone, <EOS>
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight. <EOS>
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night. <EOS>
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift <EOS>
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men! <EOS>
I do remember an apothecary,-- <EOS>
And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted <EOS>
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows, <EOS>
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks, <EOS>
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones: <EOS>
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, <EOS>
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins <EOS>
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves <EOS>
A beggarly account of empty boxes, <EOS>
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds, <EOS>
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses, <EOS>
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show. <EOS>
Noting this penury, to myself I said <EOS>
'An if a man did need a poison now, <EOS>
Whose sale is present death in Mantua, <EOS>
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.' <EOS>
O, this same thought did but forerun my need; <EOS>
And this same needy man must sell it me. <EOS>
As I remember, this should be the house. <EOS>
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. <EOS>
What, ho! apothecary! <EOS>
Apothecary: <EOS>
Who calls so loud? <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor: <EOS>
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have <EOS>
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear <EOS>
As will disperse itself through all the veins <EOS>
That the life-weary taker may fall dead <EOS>
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath <EOS>
As violently as hasty powder fired <EOS>
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb. <EOS>
Apothecary: <EOS>
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law <EOS>
Is death to any he that utters them. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, <EOS>
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks, <EOS>
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes, <EOS>
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back; <EOS>
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law; <EOS>
The world affords no law to make thee rich; <EOS>
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this. <EOS>
Apothecary: <EOS>
My poverty, but not my will, consents. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will. <EOS>
Apothecary: <EOS>
Put this in any liquid thing you will, <EOS>
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength <EOS>
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls, <EOS>
Doing more murders in this loathsome world, <EOS>
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell. <EOS>
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none. <EOS>
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh. <EOS>
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me <EOS>
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee. <EOS>
FRIAR JOHN: <EOS>
Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho! <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
This same should be the voice of Friar John. <EOS>
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo? <EOS>
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter. <EOS>
FRIAR JOHN: <EOS>
Going to find a bare-foot brother out <EOS>
One of our order, to associate me, <EOS>
Here in this city visiting the sick, <EOS>
And finding him, the searchers of the town, <EOS>
Suspecting that we both were in a house <EOS>
Where the infectious pestilence did reign, <EOS>
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth; <EOS>
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo? <EOS>
FRIAR JOHN: <EOS>
I could not send it,--here it is again,-- <EOS>
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee, <EOS>
So fearful were they of infection. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood, <EOS>
The letter was not nice but full of charge <EOS>
Of dear import, and the neglecting it <EOS>
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence; <EOS>
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight <EOS>
Unto my cell. <EOS>
FRIAR JOHN: <EOS>
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Now must I to the monument alone; <EOS>
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake: <EOS>
She will beshrew me much that Romeo <EOS>
Hath had no notice of these accidents; <EOS>
But I will write again to Mantua, <EOS>
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come; <EOS>
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb! <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof: <EOS>
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen. <EOS>
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along, <EOS>
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground; <EOS>
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, <EOS>
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves, <EOS>
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me, <EOS>
As signal that thou hear'st something approach. <EOS>
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go. <EOS>
PAGE: <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,-- <EOS>
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;-- <EOS>
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew, <EOS>
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans: <EOS>
The obsequies that I for thee will keep <EOS>
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep. <EOS>
The boy gives warning something doth approach. <EOS>
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night, <EOS>
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite? <EOS>
What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. <EOS>
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning <EOS>
See thou deliver it to my lord and father. <EOS>
Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee, <EOS>
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof, <EOS>
And do not interrupt me in my course. <EOS>
Why I descend into this bed of death, <EOS>
Is partly to behold my lady's face; <EOS>
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger <EOS>
A precious ring, a ring that I must use <EOS>
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone: <EOS>
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry <EOS>
In what I further shall intend to do, <EOS>
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint <EOS>
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs: <EOS>
The time and my intents are savage-wild, <EOS>
More fierce and more inexorable far <EOS>
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. <EOS>
BALTHASAR: <EOS>
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that: <EOS>
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow. <EOS>
BALTHASAR: <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, <EOS>
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth, <EOS>
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open, <EOS>
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food! <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
This is that banish'd haughty Montague, <EOS>
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief, <EOS>
It is supposed, the fair creature died; <EOS>
And here is come to do some villanous shame <EOS>
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him. <EOS>
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague! <EOS>
Can vengeance be pursued further than death? <EOS>
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee: <EOS>
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither. <EOS>
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man; <EOS>
Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone; <EOS>
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth, <EOS>
Put not another sin upon my head, <EOS>
By urging me to fury: O, be gone! <EOS>
By heaven, I love thee better than myself; <EOS>
For I come hither arm'd against myself: <EOS>
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say, <EOS>
A madman's mercy bade thee run away. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
I do defy thy conjurations, <EOS>
And apprehend thee for a felon here. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy! <EOS>
PAGE: <EOS>
O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch. <EOS>
PARIS: <EOS>
O, I am slain! <EOS>
If thou be merciful, <EOS>
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. <EOS>
ROMEO: <EOS>
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face. <EOS>
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris! <EOS>
What said my man, when my betossed soul <EOS>
Did not attend him as we rode? I think <EOS>
He told me Paris should have married Juliet: <EOS>
Said he not so? or did I dream it so? <EOS>
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, <EOS>
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand, <EOS>
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book! <EOS>
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave; <EOS>
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth, <EOS>
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes <EOS>
This vault a feasting presence full of light. <EOS>
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd. <EOS>
How oft when men are at the point of death <EOS>
Have they been merry! which their keepers call <EOS>
A lightning before death: O, how may I <EOS>
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife! <EOS>
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath, <EOS>
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty: <EOS>
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet <EOS>
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, <EOS>
And death's pale flag is not advanced there. <EOS>
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? <EOS>
O, what more favour can I do to thee, <EOS>
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain <EOS>
To sunder his that was thine enemy? <EOS>
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet, <EOS>
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe <EOS>
That unsubstantial death is amorous, <EOS>
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps <EOS>
Thee here in dark to be his paramour? <EOS>
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee; <EOS>
And never from this palace of dim night <EOS>
Depart again: here, here will I remain <EOS>
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here <EOS>
Will I set up my everlasting rest, <EOS>
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars <EOS>
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last! <EOS>
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you <EOS>
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss <EOS>
A dateless bargain to engrossing death! <EOS>
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide! <EOS>
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on <EOS>
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark! <EOS>
Here's to my love! <EOS>
O true apothecary! <EOS>
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night <EOS>
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there? <EOS>
BALTHASAR: <EOS>
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend, <EOS>
What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light <EOS>
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern, <EOS>
It burneth in the Capel's monument. <EOS>
BALTHASAR: <EOS>
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master, <EOS>
One that you love. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Who is it? <EOS>
BALTHASAR: <EOS>
Romeo. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
How long hath he been there? <EOS>
BALTHASAR: <EOS>
Full half an hour. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Go with me to the vault. <EOS>
BALTHASAR: <EOS>
I dare not, sir <EOS>
My master knows not but I am gone hence; <EOS>
And fearfully did menace me with death, <EOS>
If I did stay to look on his intents. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me: <EOS>
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing. <EOS>
BALTHASAR: <EOS>
As I did sleep under this yew-tree here, <EOS>
I dreamt my master and another fought, <EOS>
And that my master slew him. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
Romeo! <EOS>
Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains <EOS>
The stony entrance of this sepulchre? <EOS>
What mean these masterless and gory swords <EOS>
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? <EOS>
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too? <EOS>
And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour <EOS>
Is guilty of this lamentable chance! <EOS>
The lady stirs. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
O comfortable friar! where is my lord? <EOS>
I do remember well where I should be, <EOS>
And there I am. Where is my Romeo? <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest <EOS>
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep: <EOS>
A greater power than we can contradict <EOS>
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. <EOS>
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; <EOS>
And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee <EOS>
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns: <EOS>
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming; <EOS>
Come, go, good Juliet, <EOS>
I dare no longer stay. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away. <EOS>
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand? <EOS>
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end: <EOS>
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop <EOS>
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips; <EOS>
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, <EOS>
To make die with a restorative. <EOS>
Thy lips are warm. <EOS>
First Watchman: <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger! <EOS>
This is thy sheath; <EOS>
there rust, and let me die. <EOS>
PAGE: <EOS>
This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn. <EOS>
First Watchman: <EOS>
The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard: <EOS>
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach. <EOS>
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain, <EOS>
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, <EOS>
Who here hath lain these two days buried. <EOS>
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets: <EOS>
Raise up the Montagues: some others search: <EOS>
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie; <EOS>
But the true ground of all these piteous woes <EOS>
We cannot without circumstance descry. <EOS>
Second Watchman: <EOS>
Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard. <EOS>
First Watchman: <EOS>
Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither. <EOS>
Third Watchman: <EOS>
Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps: <EOS>
We took this mattock and this spade from him, <EOS>
As he was coming from this churchyard side. <EOS>
First Watchman: <EOS>
A great suspicion: stay the friar too. <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
What misadventure is so early up, <EOS>
That calls our person from our morning's rest? <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
What should it be, that they so shriek abroad? <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
The people in the street cry Romeo, <EOS>
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run, <EOS>
With open outcry toward our monument. <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
What fear is this which startles in our ears? <EOS>
First Watchman: <EOS>
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain; <EOS>
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before, <EOS>
Warm and new kill'd. <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes. <EOS>
First Watchman: <EOS>
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man; <EOS>
With instruments upon them, fit to open <EOS>
These dead men's tombs. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds! <EOS>
This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house <EOS>
Is empty on the back of Montague,-- <EOS>
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom! <EOS>
LADY CAPULET: <EOS>
O me! this sight of death is as a bell, <EOS>
That warns my old age to a sepulchre. <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
Come, Montague; for thou art early up, <EOS>
To see thy son and heir more early down. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night; <EOS>
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath: <EOS>
What further woe conspires against mine age? <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
Look, and thou shalt see. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
O thou untaught! what manners is in this? <EOS>
To press before thy father to a grave? <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, <EOS>
Till we can clear these ambiguities, <EOS>
And know their spring, their head, their <EOS>
true descent; <EOS>
And then will I be general of your woes, <EOS>
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear, <EOS>
And let mischance be slave to patience. <EOS>
Bring forth the parties of suspicion. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
I am the greatest, able to do least, <EOS>
Yet most suspected, as the time and place <EOS>
Doth make against me of this direful murder; <EOS>
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge <EOS>
Myself condemned and myself excused. <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
Then say at once what thou dost know in this. <EOS>
FRIAR LAURENCE: <EOS>
I will be brief, for my short date of breath <EOS>
Is not so long as is a tedious tale. <EOS>
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet; <EOS>
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife: <EOS>
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day <EOS>
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death <EOS>
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city, <EOS>
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined. <EOS>
You, to remove that siege of grief from her, <EOS>
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce <EOS>
To County Paris: then comes she to me, <EOS>
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean <EOS>
To rid her from this second marriage, <EOS>
Or in my cell there would she kill herself. <EOS>
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art, <EOS>
A sleeping potion; which so took effect <EOS>
As I intended, for it wrought on her <EOS>
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo, <EOS>
That he should hither come as this dire night, <EOS>
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave, <EOS>
Being the time the potion's force should cease. <EOS>
But he which bore my letter, Friar John, <EOS>
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight <EOS>
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone <EOS>
At the prefixed hour of her waking, <EOS>
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault; <EOS>
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell, <EOS>
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo: <EOS>
But when I came, some minute ere the time <EOS>
Of her awaking, here untimely lay <EOS>
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. <EOS>
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth, <EOS>
And bear this work of heaven with patience: <EOS>
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb; <EOS>
And she, too desperate, would not go with me, <EOS>
But, as it seems, did violence on herself. <EOS>
All this I know; and to the marriage <EOS>
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this <EOS>
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life <EOS>
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time, <EOS>
Unto the rigour of severest law. <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
We still have known thee for a holy man. <EOS>
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this? <EOS>
BALTHASAR: <EOS>
I brought my master news of Juliet's death; <EOS>
And then in post he came from Mantua <EOS>
To this same place, to this same monument. <EOS>
This letter he early bid me give his father, <EOS>
And threatened me with death, going in the vault, <EOS>
I departed not and left him there. <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
Give me the letter; I will look on it. <EOS>
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch? <EOS>
Sirrah, what made your master in this place? <EOS>
PAGE: <EOS>
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave; <EOS>
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did: <EOS>
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; <EOS>
And by and by my master drew on him; <EOS>
And then I ran away to call the watch. <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
This letter doth make good the friar's words, <EOS>
Their course of love, the tidings of her death: <EOS>
And here he writes that he did buy a poison <EOS>
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal <EOS>
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. <EOS>
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague! <EOS>
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate, <EOS>
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love. <EOS>
And I for winking at your discords too <EOS>
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
O brother Montague, give me thy hand: <EOS>
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more <EOS>
Can I demand. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
But I can give thee more: <EOS>
For I will raise her statue in pure gold; <EOS>
That while Verona by that name is known, <EOS>
There shall no figure at such rate be set <EOS>
As that of true and faithful Juliet. <EOS>
CAPULET: <EOS>
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie; <EOS>
Poor sacrifices of our enmity! <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
A glooming peace this morning with it brings; <EOS>
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head: <EOS>
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; <EOS>
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished: <EOS>
For never was a story of more woe <EOS>
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
I wonder how the king escaped our hands. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
While we pursued the horsemen of the north, <EOS>
He slily stole away and left his men: <EOS>
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland, <EOS>
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat, <EOS>
Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself, <EOS>
Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast, <EOS>
Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in <EOS>
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham, <EOS>
Is either slain or wounded dangerously; <EOS>
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow: <EOS>
That this is true, father, behold his blood. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood, <EOS>
Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Speak thou for me and tell them what I did. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Richard hath best deserved of all my sons. <EOS>
But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset? <EOS>
NORFOLK: <EOS>
Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt! <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
And so do I. Victorious Prince of York, <EOS>
Before I see thee seated in that throne <EOS>
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps, <EOS>
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close. <EOS>
This is the palace of the fearful king, <EOS>
And this the regal seat: possess it, York; <EOS>
For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs' <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will; <EOS>
For hither we have broken in by force. <EOS>
NORFOLK: <EOS>
We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords; <EOS>
And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
And when the king comes, offer no violence, <EOS>
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
The queen this day here holds her parliament, <EOS>
But little thinks we shall be of her council: <EOS>
By words or blows here let us win our right. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
The bloody parliament shall this be call'd, <EOS>
Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king, <EOS>
And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice <EOS>
Hath made us by-words to our enemies. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute; <EOS>
I mean to take possession of my right. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Neither the king, nor he that loves him best, <EOS>
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster, <EOS>
Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells. <EOS>
I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares: <EOS>
Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits, <EOS>
Even in the chair of state: belike he means, <EOS>
Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer, <EOS>
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king. <EOS>
Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father. <EOS>
And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge <EOS>
On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
If I be not, heavens be revenged on me! <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel. <EOS>
WESTMORELAND: <EOS>
What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down: <EOS>
My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Patience is for poltroons, such as he: <EOS>
He durst not sit there, had your father lived. <EOS>
My gracious lord, here in the parliament <EOS>
Let us assail the family of York. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Ah, know you not the city favours them, <EOS>
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck? <EOS>
EXETER: <EOS>
But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart, <EOS>
To make a shambles of the parliament-house! <EOS>
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats <EOS>
Shall be the war that Henry means to use. <EOS>
Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne, <EOS>
and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet; <EOS>
I am thy sovereign. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
I am thine. <EOS>
EXETER: <EOS>
For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was. <EOS>
EXETER: <EOS>
Thy father was a traitor to the crown. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown <EOS>
In following this usurping Henry. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Whom should he follow but his natural king? <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne? <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
It must and shall be so: content thyself. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king. <EOS>
WESTMORELAND: <EOS>
He is both king and Duke of Lancaster; <EOS>
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget <EOS>
That we are those which chased you from the field <EOS>
And slew your fathers, and with colours spread <EOS>
March'd through the city to the palace gates. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief; <EOS>
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it. <EOS>
WESTMORELAND: <EOS>
Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons, <EOS>
Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives <EOS>
Than drops of blood were in my father's veins. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words, <EOS>
I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger <EOS>
As shall revenge his death before I stir. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats! <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Will you we show our title to the crown? <EOS>
If not, our swords shall plead it in the field. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown? <EOS>
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York; <EOS>
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March: <EOS>
I am the son of Henry the Fifth, <EOS>
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop <EOS>
And seized upon their towns and provinces. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
The lord protector lost it, and not I: <EOS>
When I was crown'd I was but nine months old. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose. <EOS>
Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Sweet father, do so; set it on your head. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms, <EOS>
Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Sons, peace! <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords; <EOS>
And be you silent and attentive too, <EOS>
For he that interrupts him shall not live. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne, <EOS>
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat? <EOS>
No: first shall war unpeople this my realm; <EOS>
Ay, and their colours, often borne in France, <EOS>
And now in England to our heart's great sorrow, <EOS>
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords? <EOS>
My title's good, and better far than his. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
'Twas by rebellion against his king. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
What then? <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
An if he may, then am I lawful king; <EOS>
For Richard, in the view of many lords, <EOS>
Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth, <EOS>
Whose heir my father was, and I am his. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
He rose against him, being his sovereign, <EOS>
And made him to resign his crown perforce. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd, <EOS>
Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown? <EOS>
EXETER: <EOS>
No; for he could not so resign his crown <EOS>
But that the next heir should succeed and reign. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter? <EOS>
EXETER: <EOS>
His is the right, and therefore pardon me. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not? <EOS>
EXETER: <EOS>
My conscience tells me he is lawful king. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st, <EOS>
Think not that Henry shall be so deposed. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Deposed he shall be, in despite of all. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power, <EOS>
Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent, <EOS>
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud, <EOS>
Can set the duke up in despite of me. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
King Henry, be thy title right or wrong, <EOS>
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence: <EOS>
May that ground gape and swallow me alive, <EOS>
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father! <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart! <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown. <EOS>
What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords? <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Do right unto this princely Duke of York, <EOS>
Or I will fill the house with armed men, <EOS>
And over the chair of state, where now he sits, <EOS>
Write up his title with usurping blood. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word: <EOS>
Let me for this my life-time reign as king. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs, <EOS>
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
I am content: Richard Plantagenet, <EOS>
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
What wrong is this unto the prince your son! <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
What good is this to England and himself! <EOS>
WESTMORELAND: <EOS>
Base, fearful and despairing Henry! <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
How hast thou injured both thyself and us! <EOS>
WESTMORELAND: <EOS>
I cannot stay to hear these articles. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Nor I. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news. <EOS>
WESTMORELAND: <EOS>
Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king, <EOS>
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Be thou a prey unto the house of York, <EOS>
And die in bands for this unmanly deed! <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome, <EOS>
Or live in peace abandon'd and despised! <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not. <EOS>
EXETER: <EOS>
They seek revenge and therefore will not yield. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Ah, Exeter! <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Why should you sigh, my lord? <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son, <EOS>
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit. <EOS>
But be it as it may: I here entail <EOS>
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever; <EOS>
Conditionally, that here thou take an oath <EOS>
To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live, <EOS>
To honour me as thy king and sovereign, <EOS>
And neither by treason nor hostility <EOS>
To seek to put me down and reign thyself. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
This oath I willingly take and will perform. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
And long live thou and these thy forward sons! <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Now York and Lancaster are reconciled. <EOS>
EXETER: <EOS>
Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes! <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
And I'll keep London with my soldiers. <EOS>
NORFOLK: <EOS>
And I to Norfolk with my followers. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
And I unto the sea from whence I came. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court. <EOS>
EXETER: <EOS>
Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger: <EOS>
I'll steal away. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Exeter, so will I. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Who can be patient in such extremes? <EOS>
Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid <EOS>
And never seen thee, never borne thee son, <EOS>
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father <EOS>
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus? <EOS>
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I, <EOS>
Or felt that pain which I did for him once, <EOS>
Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood, <EOS>
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there, <EOS>
Rather than have that savage duke thine heir <EOS>
And disinherited thine only son. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
Father, you cannot disinherit me: <EOS>
If you be king, why should not I succeed? <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son: <EOS>
The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced? <EOS>
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch! <EOS>
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me; <EOS>
And given unto the house of York such head <EOS>
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance. <EOS>
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown, <EOS>
What is it, but to make thy sepulchre <EOS>
And creep into it far before thy time? <EOS>
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais; <EOS>
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas; <EOS>
The duke is made protector of the realm; <EOS>
And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds <EOS>
The trembling lamb environed with wolves. <EOS>
Had I been there, which am a silly woman, <EOS>
The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes <EOS>
Before I would have granted to that act. <EOS>
But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour: <EOS>
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself <EOS>
Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed, <EOS>
Until that act of parliament be repeal'd <EOS>
Whereby my son is disinherited. <EOS>
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours <EOS>
Will follow mine, if once they see them spread; <EOS>
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace <EOS>
And utter ruin of the house of York. <EOS>
Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away; <EOS>
Our army is ready; come, we'll after them. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
When I return with victory from the field <EOS>
I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Come, son, away; we may not linger thus. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Poor queen! how love to me and to her son <EOS>
Hath made her break out into terms of rage! <EOS>
Revenged may she be on that hateful duke, <EOS>
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire, <EOS>
Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle <EOS>
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son! <EOS>
The loss of those three lords torments my heart: <EOS>
I'll write unto them and entreat them fair. <EOS>
Come, cousin you shall be the messenger. <EOS>
EXETER: <EOS>
And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
No, I can better play the orator. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
But I have reasons strong and forcible. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife? <EOS>
What is your quarrel? how began it first? <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
No quarrel, but a slight contention. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
About what? <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
About that which concerns your grace and us; <EOS>
The crown of England, father, which is yours. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Your right depends not on his life or death. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now: <EOS>
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe, <EOS>
It will outrun you, father, in the end. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
I took an oath that he should quietly reign. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken: <EOS>
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
I shall be, if I claim by open war. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Thou canst not, son; it is impossible. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
An oath is of no moment, being not took <EOS>
Before a true and lawful magistrate, <EOS>
That hath authority over him that swears: <EOS>
Henry had none, but did usurp the place; <EOS>
Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose, <EOS>
Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous. <EOS>
Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think <EOS>
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown; <EOS>
Within whose circuit is Elysium <EOS>
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy. <EOS>
Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest <EOS>
Until the white rose that I wear be dyed <EOS>
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Richard, enough; I will be king, or die. <EOS>
Brother, thou shalt to London presently, <EOS>
And whet on Warwick to this enterprise. <EOS>
Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk, <EOS>
And tell him privily of our intent. <EOS>
You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham, <EOS>
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise: <EOS>
In them I trust; for they are soldiers, <EOS>
Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit. <EOS>
While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more, <EOS>
But that I seek occasion how to rise, <EOS>
And yet the king not privy to my drift, <EOS>
Nor any of the house of Lancaster? <EOS>
But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
The queen with all the northern earls and lords <EOS>
Intend here to besiege you in your castle: <EOS>
She is hard by with twenty thousand men; <EOS>
And therefore fortify your hold, my lord. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them? <EOS>
Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me; <EOS>
My brother Montague shall post to London: <EOS>
Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest, <EOS>
Whom we have left protectors of the king, <EOS>
With powerful policy strengthen themselves, <EOS>
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not: <EOS>
And thus most humbly I do take my leave. <EOS>
Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles, <EOS>
You are come to Sandal in a happy hour; <EOS>
The army of the queen mean to besiege us. <EOS>
JOHN MORTIMER: <EOS>
She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
What, with five thousand men? <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need: <EOS>
A woman's general; what should we fear? <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
I hear their drums: let's set our men in order, <EOS>
And issue forth and bid them battle straight. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Five men to twenty! though the odds be great, <EOS>
I doubt not, uncle, of our victory. <EOS>
Many a battle have I won in France, <EOS>
When as the enemy hath been ten to one: <EOS>
Why should I not now have the like success? <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
RUTLAND: <EOS>
Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands? <EOS>
Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes! <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life. <EOS>
As for the brat of this accursed duke, <EOS>
Whose father slew my father, he shall die. <EOS>
Tutor: <EOS>
And I, my lord, will bear him company. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Soldiers, away with him! <EOS>
Tutor: <EOS>
Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child, <EOS>
Lest thou be hated both of God and man! <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
How now! is he dead already? or is it fear <EOS>
That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them. <EOS>
RUTLAND: <EOS>
So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch <EOS>
That trembles under his devouring paws; <EOS>
And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey, <EOS>
And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder. <EOS>
Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword, <EOS>
And not with such a cruel threatening look. <EOS>
Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die. <EOS>
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath: <EOS>
Be thou revenged on men, and let me live. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood <EOS>
Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter. <EOS>
RUTLAND: <EOS>
Then let my father's blood open it again: <EOS>
He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine <EOS>
Were not revenge sufficient for me; <EOS>
No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves <EOS>
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains, <EOS>
It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart. <EOS>
The sight of any of the house of York <EOS>
Is as a fury to torment my soul; <EOS>
And till I root out their accursed line <EOS>
And leave not one alive, I live in hell. <EOS>
Therefore-- <EOS>
RUTLAND: <EOS>
O, let me pray before I take my death! <EOS>
To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me! <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Such pity as my rapier's point affords. <EOS>
RUTLAND: <EOS>
I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me? <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Thy father hath. <EOS>
RUTLAND: <EOS>
But 'twas ere I was born. <EOS>
Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me, <EOS>
Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just, <EOS>
He be as miserably slain as I. <EOS>
Ah, let me live in prison all my days; <EOS>
And when I give occasion of offence, <EOS>
Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
No cause! <EOS>
Thy father slew my father; therefore, die. <EOS>
RUTLAND: <EOS>
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae! <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Plantagenet! I come, Plantagenet! <EOS>
And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade <EOS>
Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood, <EOS>
Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
The army of the queen hath got the field: <EOS>
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me; <EOS>
And all my followers to the eager foe <EOS>
Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind <EOS>
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves. <EOS>
My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them: <EOS>
But this I know, they have demean'd themselves <EOS>
Like men born to renown by life or death. <EOS>
Three times did Richard make a lane to me. <EOS>
And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!' <EOS>
And full as oft came Edward to my side, <EOS>
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt <EOS>
In blood of those that had encounter'd him: <EOS>
And when the hardiest warriors did retire, <EOS>
Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!' <EOS>
And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb! <EOS>
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!' <EOS>
With this, we charged again: but, out, alas! <EOS>
We bodged again; as I have seen a swan <EOS>
With bootless labour swim against the tide <EOS>
And spend her strength with over-matching waves. <EOS>
Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue; <EOS>
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury: <EOS>
And were I strong, I would not shun their fury: <EOS>
The sands are number'd that make up my life; <EOS>
Here must I stay, and here my life must end. <EOS>
Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland, <EOS>
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage: <EOS>
I am your butt, and I abide your shot. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm, <EOS>
With downright payment, show'd unto my father. <EOS>
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car, <EOS>
And made an evening at the noontide prick. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth <EOS>
A bird that will revenge upon you all: <EOS>
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven, <EOS>
Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with. <EOS>
Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear? <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
So cowards fight when they can fly no further; <EOS>
So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons; <EOS>
So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives, <EOS>
Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
O Clifford, but bethink thee once again, <EOS>
And in thy thought o'er-run my former time; <EOS>
And, if though canst for blushing, view this face, <EOS>
And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice <EOS>
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this! <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
I will not bandy with thee word for word, <EOS>
But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes <EOS>
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life. <EOS>
Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much <EOS>
To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart: <EOS>
What valour were it, when a cur doth grin, <EOS>
For one to thrust his hand between his teeth, <EOS>
When he might spurn him with his foot away? <EOS>
It is war's prize to take all vantages; <EOS>
And ten to one is no impeach of valour. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
So doth the cony struggle in the net. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty; <EOS>
So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
What would your grace have done unto him now? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland, <EOS>
Come, make him stand upon this molehill here, <EOS>
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms, <EOS>
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand. <EOS>
What! was it you that would be England's king? <EOS>
Was't you that revell'd in our parliament, <EOS>
And made a preachment of your high descent? <EOS>
Where are your mess of sons to back you now? <EOS>
The wanton Edward, and the lusty George? <EOS>
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy, <EOS>
Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice <EOS>
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies? <EOS>
Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland? <EOS>
Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood <EOS>
That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point, <EOS>
Made issue from the bosom of the boy; <EOS>
And if thine eyes can water for his death, <EOS>
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal. <EOS>
Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly, <EOS>
I should lament thy miserable state. <EOS>
I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York. <EOS>
What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails <EOS>
That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death? <EOS>
Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad; <EOS>
And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus. <EOS>
Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance. <EOS>
Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport: <EOS>
York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown. <EOS>
A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him: <EOS>
Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on. <EOS>
Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king! <EOS>
Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair, <EOS>
And this is he was his adopted heir. <EOS>
But how is it that great Plantagenet <EOS>
Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath? <EOS>
As I bethink me, you should not be king <EOS>
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death. <EOS>
And will you pale your head in Henry's glory, <EOS>
And rob his temples of the diadem, <EOS>
Now in his life, against your holy oath? <EOS>
O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable! <EOS>
Off with the crown, and with the crown his head; <EOS>
And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
That is my office, for my father's sake. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France, <EOS>
Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth! <EOS>
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex <EOS>
To triumph, like an Amazonian trull, <EOS>
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates! <EOS>
But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging, <EOS>
Made impudent with use of evil deeds, <EOS>
I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush. <EOS>
To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived, <EOS>
Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless. <EOS>
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples, <EOS>
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem, <EOS>
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman. <EOS>
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult? <EOS>
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen, <EOS>
Unless the adage must be verified, <EOS>
That beggars mounted run their horse to death. <EOS>
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud; <EOS>
But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small: <EOS>
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired; <EOS>
The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at: <EOS>
'Tis government that makes them seem divine; <EOS>
The want thereof makes thee abominable: <EOS>
Thou art as opposite to every good <EOS>
As the Antipodes are unto us, <EOS>
Or as the south to the septentrion. <EOS>
O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide! <EOS>
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child, <EOS>
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal, <EOS>
And yet be seen to bear a woman's face? <EOS>
Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible; <EOS>
Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless. <EOS>
Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish: <EOS>
Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will: <EOS>
For raging wind blows up incessant showers, <EOS>
And when the rage allays, the rain begins. <EOS>
These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies: <EOS>
And every drop cries vengeance for his death, <EOS>
'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false <EOS>
Frenchwoman. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so <EOS>
That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
That face of his the hungry cannibals <EOS>
Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood: <EOS>
But you are more inhuman, more inexorable, <EOS>
O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania. <EOS>
See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears: <EOS>
This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy, <EOS>
And I with tears do wash the blood away. <EOS>
Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this: <EOS>
And if thou tell'st the heavy story right, <EOS>
Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears; <EOS>
Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears, <EOS>
And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!' <EOS>
There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse; <EOS>
And in thy need such comfort come to thee <EOS>
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand! <EOS>
Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world: <EOS>
My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads! <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin, <EOS>
I should not for my life but weep with him. <EOS>
To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland? <EOS>
Think but upon the wrong he did us all, <EOS>
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
And here's to right our gentle-hearted king. <EOS>
YORK: <EOS>
Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God! <EOS>
My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Off with his head, and set it on York gates; <EOS>
So York may overlook the town of York. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
I wonder how our princely father 'scaped, <EOS>
Or whether he be 'scaped away or no <EOS>
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit: <EOS>
Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news; <EOS>
Had he been slain, we should have heard the news; <EOS>
Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard <EOS>
The happy tidings of his good escape. <EOS>
How fares my brother? why is he so sad? <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
I cannot joy, until I be resolved <EOS>
Where our right valiant father is become. <EOS>
I saw him in the battle range about; <EOS>
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth. <EOS>
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop <EOS>
As doth a lion in a herd of neat; <EOS>
Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs, <EOS>
Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry, <EOS>
The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him. <EOS>
So fared our father with his enemies; <EOS>
So fled his enemies my warlike father: <EOS>
Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son. <EOS>
See how the morning opes her golden gates, <EOS>
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun! <EOS>
How well resembles it the prime of youth, <EOS>
Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love! <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns? <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun; <EOS>
Not separated with the racking clouds, <EOS>
But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky. <EOS>
See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss, <EOS>
As if they vow'd some league inviolable: <EOS>
Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun. <EOS>
In this the heaven figures some event. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of. <EOS>
I think it cites us, brother, to the field, <EOS>
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet, <EOS>
Each one already blazing by our meeds, <EOS>
Should notwithstanding join our lights together <EOS>
And over-shine the earth as this the world. <EOS>
Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear <EOS>
Upon my target three fair-shining suns. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it, <EOS>
You love the breeder better than the male. <EOS>
But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell <EOS>
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Ah, one that was a woful looker-on <EOS>
When as the noble Duke of York was slain, <EOS>
Your princely father and my loving lord! <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
O, speak no more, for I have heard too much. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Say how he died, for I will hear it all. <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Environed he was with many foes, <EOS>
And stood against them, as the hope of Troy <EOS>
Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy. <EOS>
But Hercules himself must yield to odds; <EOS>
And many strokes, though with a little axe, <EOS>
Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak. <EOS>
By many hands your father was subdued; <EOS>
But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm <EOS>
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen, <EOS>
Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite, <EOS>
Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept, <EOS>
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks <EOS>
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood <EOS>
Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain: <EOS>
And after many scorns, many foul taunts, <EOS>
They took his head, and on the gates of York <EOS>
They set the same; and there it doth remain, <EOS>
The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon, <EOS>
Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay. <EOS>
O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain <EOS>
The flower of Europe for his chivalry; <EOS>
And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him, <EOS>
For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee. <EOS>
Now my soul's palace is become a prison: <EOS>
Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body <EOS>
Might in the ground be closed up in rest! <EOS>
For never henceforth shall I joy again, <EOS>
Never, O never shall I see more joy! <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture <EOS>
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart: <EOS>
Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen; <EOS>
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal <EOS>
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast, <EOS>
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench. <EOS>
To weep is to make less the depth of grief: <EOS>
Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me <EOS>
Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death, <EOS>
Or die renowned by attempting it. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
His name that valiant duke hath left with thee; <EOS>
His dukedom and his chair with me is left. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird, <EOS>
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun: <EOS>
For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say; <EOS>
Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad? <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount <EOS>
Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance <EOS>
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told, <EOS>
The words would add more anguish than the wounds. <EOS>
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain! <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet, <EOS>
Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption, <EOS>
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears; <EOS>
And now, to add more measure to your woes, <EOS>
I come to tell you things sith then befall'n. <EOS>
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought, <EOS>
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp, <EOS>
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run, <EOS>
Were brought me of your loss and his depart. <EOS>
I, then in London keeper of the king, <EOS>
Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends, <EOS>
And very well appointed, as I thought, <EOS>
March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen, <EOS>
Bearing the king in my behalf along; <EOS>
For by my scouts I was advertised <EOS>
That she was coming with a full intent <EOS>
To dash our late decree in parliament <EOS>
Touching King Henry's oath and your succession. <EOS>
Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met <EOS>
Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought: <EOS>
But whether 'twas the coldness of the king, <EOS>
Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen, <EOS>
That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen; <EOS>
Or whether 'twas report of her success; <EOS>
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour, <EOS>
Who thunders to his captives blood and death, <EOS>
I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth, <EOS>
Their weapons like to lightning came and went; <EOS>
Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight, <EOS>
Or like an idle thresher with a flail, <EOS>
Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends. <EOS>
I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause, <EOS>
With promise of high pay and great rewards: <EOS>
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight, <EOS>
And we in them no hope to win the day; <EOS>
So that we fled; the king unto the queen; <EOS>
Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself, <EOS>
In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you: <EOS>
For in the marches here we heard you were, <EOS>
Making another head to fight again. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick? <EOS>
And when came George from Burgundy to England? <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers; <EOS>
And for your brother, he was lately sent <EOS>
From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy, <EOS>
With aid of soldiers to this needful war. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled: <EOS>
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit, <EOS>
But ne'er till now his scandal of retire. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear; <EOS>
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine <EOS>
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head, <EOS>
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist, <EOS>
Were he as famous and as bold in war <EOS>
As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not: <EOS>
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak. <EOS>
But in this troublous time what's to be done? <EOS>
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel, <EOS>
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns, <EOS>
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads? <EOS>
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes <EOS>
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms? <EOS>
If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out; <EOS>
And therefore comes my brother Montague. <EOS>
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen, <EOS>
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland, <EOS>
And of their feather many more proud birds, <EOS>
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax. <EOS>
He swore consent to your succession, <EOS>
His oath enrolled in the parliament; <EOS>
And now to London all the crew are gone, <EOS>
To frustrate both his oath and what beside <EOS>
May make against the house of Lancaster. <EOS>
Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong: <EOS>
Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself, <EOS>
With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March, <EOS>
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure, <EOS>
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand, <EOS>
Why, Via! to London will we march amain, <EOS>
And once again bestride our foaming steeds, <EOS>
And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!' <EOS>
But never once again turn back and fly. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak: <EOS>
Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day, <EOS>
That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean; <EOS>
And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!-- <EOS>
Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend! <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York: <EOS>
The next degree is England's royal throne; <EOS>
For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd <EOS>
In every borough as we pass along; <EOS>
And he that throws not up his cap for joy <EOS>
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head. <EOS>
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague, <EOS>
Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown, <EOS>
But sound the trumpets, and about our task. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel, <EOS>
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds, <EOS>
I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us! <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
How now! what news? <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me, <EOS>
The queen is coming with a puissant host; <EOS>
And craves your company for speedy counsel. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York. <EOS>
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy <EOS>
That sought to be encompass'd with your crown: <EOS>
Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord? <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck: <EOS>
To see this sight, it irks my very soul. <EOS>
Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault, <EOS>
Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
My gracious liege, this too much lenity <EOS>
And harmful pity must be laid aside. <EOS>
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks? <EOS>
Not to the beast that would usurp their den. <EOS>
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick? <EOS>
Not his that spoils her young before her face. <EOS>
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting? <EOS>
Not he that sets his foot upon her back. <EOS>
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on, <EOS>
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood. <EOS>
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown, <EOS>
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows: <EOS>
He, but a duke, would have his son a king, <EOS>
And raise his issue, like a loving sire; <EOS>
Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son, <EOS>
Didst yield consent to disinherit him, <EOS>
Which argued thee a most unloving father. <EOS>
Unreasonable creatures feed their young; <EOS>
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes, <EOS>
Yet, in protection of their tender ones, <EOS>
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings <EOS>
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight, <EOS>
Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest, <EOS>
Offer their own lives in their young's defence? <EOS>
For shame, my liege, make them your precedent! <EOS>
Were it not pity that this goodly boy <EOS>
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault, <EOS>
And long hereafter say unto his child, <EOS>
'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got <EOS>
My careless father fondly gave away'? <EOS>
Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy; <EOS>
And let his manly face, which promiseth <EOS>
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart <EOS>
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator, <EOS>
Inferring arguments of mighty force. <EOS>
But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear <EOS>
That things ill-got had ever bad success? <EOS>
And happy always was it for that son <EOS>
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell? <EOS>
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind; <EOS>
And would my father had left me no more! <EOS>
For all the rest is held at such a rate <EOS>
As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep <EOS>
Than in possession and jot of pleasure. <EOS>
Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know <EOS>
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here! <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh, <EOS>
And this soft courage makes your followers faint. <EOS>
You promised knighthood to our forward son: <EOS>
Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently. <EOS>
Edward, kneel down. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight; <EOS>
And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right. <EOS>
PRINCE: <EOS>
My gracious father, by your kingly leave, <EOS>
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown, <EOS>
And in that quarrel use it to the death. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Why, that is spoken like a toward prince. <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Royal commanders, be in readiness: <EOS>
For with a band of thirty thousand men <EOS>
Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York; <EOS>
And in the towns, as they do march along, <EOS>
Proclaims him king, and many fly to him: <EOS>
Darraign your battle, for they are at hand. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
I would your highness would depart the field: <EOS>
The queen hath best success when you are absent. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
Be it with resolution then to fight. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
My royal father, cheer these noble lords <EOS>
And hearten those that fight in your defence: <EOS>
Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!' <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace, <EOS>
And set thy diadem upon my head; <EOS>
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy! <EOS>
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms <EOS>
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king? <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
I am his king, and he should bow his knee; <EOS>
I was adopted heir by his consent: <EOS>
Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear, <EOS>
You, that are king, though he do wear the crown, <EOS>
Have caused him, by new act of parliament, <EOS>
To blot out me, and put his own son in. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
And reason too: <EOS>
Who should succeed the father but the son? <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak! <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee, <EOS>
Or any he the proudest of thy sort. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not? <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak? <EOS>
When you and I met at Saint Alban's last, <EOS>
Your legs did better service than your hands. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
You said so much before, and yet you fled. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence. <EOS>
NORTHUMBERLAND: <EOS>
No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Northumberland, I hold thee reverently. <EOS>
Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain <EOS>
The execution of my big-swoln heart <EOS>
Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child? <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward, <EOS>
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland; <EOS>
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
I prithee, give no limits to my tongue: <EOS>
I am a king, and privileged to speak. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here <EOS>
Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword: <EOS>
By him that made us all, I am resolved <EOS>
that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no? <EOS>
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day, <EOS>
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
If thou deny, their blood upon thy head; <EOS>
For York in justice puts his armour on. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
If that be right which Warwick says is right, <EOS>
There is no wrong, but every thing is right. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands; <EOS>
For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam; <EOS>
But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic, <EOS>
Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided, <EOS>
As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt, <EOS>
Whose father bears the title of a king,-- <EOS>
As if a channel should be call'd the sea,-- <EOS>
Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught, <EOS>
To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart? <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns, <EOS>
To make this shameless callet know herself. <EOS>
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou, <EOS>
Although thy husband may be Menelaus; <EOS>
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd <EOS>
By that false woman, as this king by thee. <EOS>
His father revell'd in the heart of France, <EOS>
And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop; <EOS>
And had he match'd according to his state, <EOS>
He might have kept that glory to this day; <EOS>
But when he took a beggar to his bed, <EOS>
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day, <EOS>
Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him, <EOS>
That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France, <EOS>
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home. <EOS>
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride? <EOS>
Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept; <EOS>
And we, in pity of the gentle king, <EOS>
Had slipp'd our claim until another age. <EOS>
GEORGE: <EOS>
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring, <EOS>
And that thy summer bred us no increase, <EOS>
We set the axe to thy usurping root; <EOS>
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves, <EOS>
Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike, <EOS>
We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down, <EOS>
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
And, in this resolution, I defy thee; <EOS>
Not willing any longer conference, <EOS>
Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak. <EOS>
Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave! <EOS>
And either victory, or else a grave. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Stay, Edward. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay: <EOS>
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Forspent with toil, as runners with a race, <EOS>
I lay me down a little while to breathe; <EOS>
For strokes received, and many blows repaid, <EOS>
Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength, <EOS>
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death! <EOS>
For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good? <EOS>
GEORGE: <EOS>
Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair; <EOS>
Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us: <EOS>
What counsel give you? whither shall we fly? <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings; <EOS>
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself? <EOS>
Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk, <EOS>
Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance; <EOS>
And in the very pangs of death he cried, <EOS>
Like to a dismal clangour heard from far, <EOS>
'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!' <EOS>
So, underneath the belly of their steeds, <EOS>
That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood, <EOS>
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Then let the earth be drunken with our blood: <EOS>
I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly. <EOS>
Why stand we like soft-hearted women here, <EOS>
Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage; <EOS>
And look upon, as if the tragedy <EOS>
Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors? <EOS>
Here on my knee I vow to God above, <EOS>
I'll never pause again, never stand still, <EOS>
Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine <EOS>
Or fortune given me measure of revenge. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine; <EOS>
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine! <EOS>
And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face, <EOS>
I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee, <EOS>
Thou setter up and plucker down of kings, <EOS>
Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands <EOS>
That to my foes this body must be prey, <EOS>
Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope, <EOS>
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul! <EOS>
Now, lords, take leave until we meet again, <EOS>
Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick, <EOS>
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms: <EOS>
I, that did never weep, now melt with woe <EOS>
That winter should cut off our spring-time so. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell. <EOS>
GEORGE: <EOS>
Yet let us all together to our troops, <EOS>
And give them leave to fly that will not stay; <EOS>
And call them pillars that will stand to us; <EOS>
And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards <EOS>
As victors wear at the Olympian games: <EOS>
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts; <EOS>
For yet is hope of life and victory. <EOS>
Forslow no longer, make we hence amain. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone: <EOS>
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York, <EOS>
And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge, <EOS>
Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall. <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone: <EOS>
This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York; <EOS>
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland; <EOS>
And here's the heart that triumphs in their death <EOS>
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother <EOS>
To execute the like upon thyself; <EOS>
And so, have at thee! <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Nay Warwick, single out some other chase; <EOS>
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
This battle fares like to the morning's war, <EOS>
When dying clouds contend with growing light, <EOS>
What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails, <EOS>
Can neither call it perfect day nor night. <EOS>
Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea <EOS>
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind; <EOS>
Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea <EOS>
Forced to retire by fury of the wind: <EOS>
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind; <EOS>
Now one the better, then another best; <EOS>
Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast, <EOS>
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered: <EOS>
So is the equal of this fell war. <EOS>
Here on this molehill will I sit me down. <EOS>
To whom God will, there be the victory! <EOS>
For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too, <EOS>
Have chid me from the battle; swearing both <EOS>
They prosper best of all when I am thence. <EOS>
Would I were dead! if God's good will were so; <EOS>
For what is in this world but grief and woe? <EOS>
O God! methinks it were a happy life, <EOS>
To be no better than a homely swain; <EOS>
To sit upon a hill, as I do now, <EOS>
To carve out dials quaintly, point by point, <EOS>
Thereby to see the minutes how they run, <EOS>
How many make the hour full complete; <EOS>
How many hours bring about the day; <EOS>
How many days will finish up the year; <EOS>
How many years a mortal man may live. <EOS>
When this is known, then to divide the times: <EOS>
So many hours must I tend my flock; <EOS>
So many hours must I take my rest; <EOS>
So many hours must I contemplate; <EOS>
So many hours must I sport myself; <EOS>
So many days my ewes have been with young; <EOS>
So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean: <EOS>
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece: <EOS>
So minutes, hours, days, months, and years, <EOS>
Pass'd over to the end they were created, <EOS>
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave. <EOS>
Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely! <EOS>
Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade <EOS>
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep, <EOS>
Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy <EOS>
To kings that fear their subjects' treachery? <EOS>
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth. <EOS>
And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds, <EOS>
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle. <EOS>
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade, <EOS>
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys, <EOS>
Is far beyond a prince's delicates, <EOS>
His viands sparkling in a golden cup, <EOS>
His body couched in a curious bed, <EOS>
When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him. <EOS>
Son: <EOS>
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody. <EOS>
This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight, <EOS>
May be possessed with some store of crowns; <EOS>
And I, that haply take them from him now, <EOS>
May yet ere night yield both my life and them <EOS>
To some man else, as this dead man doth me. <EOS>
Who's this? O God! it is my father's face, <EOS>
Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd. <EOS>
O heavy times, begetting such events! <EOS>
From London by the king was I press'd forth; <EOS>
My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man, <EOS>
Came on the part of York, press'd by his master; <EOS>
And I, who at his hands received my life, him <EOS>
Have by my hands of life bereaved him. <EOS>
Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did! <EOS>
And pardon, father, for I knew not thee! <EOS>
My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks; <EOS>
And no more words till they have flow'd their fill. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times! <EOS>
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens, <EOS>
Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity. <EOS>
Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear; <EOS>
And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war, <EOS>
Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief. <EOS>
Father: <EOS>
Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me, <EOS>
Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold: <EOS>
For I have bought it with an hundred blows. <EOS>
But let me see: is this our foeman's face? <EOS>
Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son! <EOS>
Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee, <EOS>
Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise, <EOS>
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart, <EOS>
Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart! <EOS>
O, pity, God, this miserable age! <EOS>
What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly, <EOS>
Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural, <EOS>
This deadly quarrel daily doth beget! <EOS>
O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon, <EOS>
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late! <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Woe above woe! grief more than common grief! <EOS>
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds! <EOS>
O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity! <EOS>
The red rose and the white are on his face, <EOS>
The fatal colours of our striving houses: <EOS>
The one his purple blood right well resembles; <EOS>
The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth: <EOS>
Wither one rose, and let the other flourish; <EOS>
If you contend, a thousand lives must wither. <EOS>
Son: <EOS>
How will my mother for a father's death <EOS>
Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied! <EOS>
Father: <EOS>
How will my wife for slaughter of my son <EOS>
Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied! <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
How will the country for these woful chances <EOS>
Misthink the king and not be satisfied! <EOS>
Son: <EOS>
Was ever son so rued a father's death? <EOS>
Father: <EOS>
Was ever father so bemoan'd his son? <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe? <EOS>
Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much. <EOS>
Son: <EOS>
I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill. <EOS>
Father: <EOS>
These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet; <EOS>
My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre, <EOS>
For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go; <EOS>
My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell; <EOS>
And so obsequious will thy father be, <EOS>
Even for the loss of thee, having no more, <EOS>
As Priam was for all his valiant sons. <EOS>
I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will, <EOS>
For I have murdered where I should not kill. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care, <EOS>
Here sits a king more woful than you are. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled, <EOS>
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull: <EOS>
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain: <EOS>
Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds <EOS>
Having the fearful flying hare in sight, <EOS>
With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath, <EOS>
And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands, <EOS>
Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain. <EOS>
EXETER: <EOS>
Away! for vengeance comes along with them: <EOS>
Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed; <EOS>
Or else come after: I'll away before. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter: <EOS>
Not that I fear to stay, but love to go <EOS>
Whither the queen intends. Forward; away! <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
CLIFFORD: <EOS>
Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies, <EOS>
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light. <EOS>
O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow <EOS>
More than my body's parting with my soul! <EOS>
My love and fear glued many friends to thee; <EOS>
And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts. <EOS>
Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York, <EOS>
The common people swarm like summer flies; <EOS>
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun? <EOS>
And who shines now but Henry's enemies? <EOS>
O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent <EOS>
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds, <EOS>
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth! <EOS>
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do, <EOS>
Or as thy father and his father did, <EOS>
Giving no ground unto the house of York, <EOS>
They never then had sprung like summer flies; <EOS>
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm <EOS>
Had left no mourning widows for our death; <EOS>
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace. <EOS>
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air? <EOS>
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity? <EOS>
Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds; <EOS>
No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight: <EOS>
The foe is merciless, and will not pity; <EOS>
For at their hands I have deserved no pity. <EOS>
The air hath got into my deadly wounds, <EOS>
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint. <EOS>
Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest; <EOS>
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause, <EOS>
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks. <EOS>
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen, <EOS>
That led calm Henry, though he were a king, <EOS>
As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust, <EOS>
Command an argosy to stem the waves. <EOS>
But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them? <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
No, 'tis impossible he should escape, <EOS>
For, though before his face I speak the words <EOS>
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave: <EOS>
And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave? <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
See who it is: and, now the battle's ended, <EOS>
If friend or foe, let him be gently used. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford; <EOS>
Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch <EOS>
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth, <EOS>
But set his murdering knife unto the root <EOS>
From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring, <EOS>
I mean our princely father, Duke of York. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
From off the gates of York fetch down the head, <EOS>
Your father's head, which Clifford placed there; <EOS>
Instead whereof let this supply the room: <EOS>
Measure for measure must be answered. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house, <EOS>
That nothing sung but death to us and ours: <EOS>
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound, <EOS>
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
I think his understanding is bereft. <EOS>
Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee? <EOS>
Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life, <EOS>
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth: <EOS>
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit, <EOS>
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts <EOS>
Which in the time of death he gave our father. <EOS>
GEORGE: <EOS>
If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Clifford, repent in bootless penitence. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults. <EOS>
GEORGE: <EOS>
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Thou didst love York, and I am son to York. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee. <EOS>
GEORGE: <EOS>
Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now? <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard <EOS>
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath. <EOS>
I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul, <EOS>
If this right hand would buy two hour's life, <EOS>
That I in all despite might rail at him, <EOS>
This hand should chop it off, and with the <EOS>
issuing blood <EOS>
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst <EOS>
York and young Rutland could not satisfy. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head, <EOS>
And rear it in the place your father's stands. <EOS>
And now to London with triumphant march, <EOS>
There to be crowned England's royal king: <EOS>
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France, <EOS>
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen: <EOS>
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together; <EOS>
And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread <EOS>
The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again; <EOS>
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt, <EOS>
Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears. <EOS>
First will I see the coronation; <EOS>
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea, <EOS>
To effect this marriage, so it please my lord. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be; <EOS>
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat, <EOS>
And never will I undertake the thing <EOS>
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting. <EOS>
Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester, <EOS>
And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself, <EOS>
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best. <EOS>
RICHARD: <EOS>
Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester; <EOS>
For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Tut, that's a foolish observation: <EOS>
Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London, <EOS>
To see these honours in possession. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
First Keeper: <EOS>
Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves; <EOS>
For through this laund anon the deer will come; <EOS>
And in this covert will we make our stand, <EOS>
Culling the principal of all the deer. <EOS>
Second Keeper: <EOS>
I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot. <EOS>
First Keeper: <EOS>
That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow <EOS>
Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost. <EOS>
Here stand we both, and aim we at the best: <EOS>
And, for the time shall not seem tedious, <EOS>
I'll tell thee what befell me on a day <EOS>
In this self-place where now we mean to stand. <EOS>
Second Keeper: <EOS>
Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love, <EOS>
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight. <EOS>
No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine; <EOS>
Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee, <EOS>
Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed: <EOS>
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now, <EOS>
No humble suitors press to speak for right, <EOS>
No, not a man comes for redress of thee; <EOS>
For how can I help them, and not myself? <EOS>
First Keeper: <EOS>
Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee: <EOS>
This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Let me embrace thee, sour adversity, <EOS>
For wise men say it is the wisest course. <EOS>
Second Keeper: <EOS>
Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him. <EOS>
First Keeper: <EOS>
Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
My queen and son are gone to France for aid; <EOS>
And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick <EOS>
Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister <EOS>
To wife for Edward: if this news be true, <EOS>
Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost; <EOS>
For Warwick is a subtle orator, <EOS>
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words. <EOS>
By this account then Margaret may win him; <EOS>
For she's a woman to be pitied much: <EOS>
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast; <EOS>
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart; <EOS>
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn; <EOS>
And Nero will be tainted with remorse, <EOS>
To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears. <EOS>
Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give; <EOS>
She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry, <EOS>
He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward. <EOS>
She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed; <EOS>
He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd; <EOS>
That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more; <EOS>
Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong, <EOS>
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength, <EOS>
And in conclusion wins the king from her, <EOS>
With promise of his sister, and what else, <EOS>
To strengthen and support King Edward's place. <EOS>
O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul, <EOS>
Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn! <EOS>
Second Keeper: <EOS>
Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens? <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
More than I seem, and less than I was born to: <EOS>
A man at least, for less I should not be; <EOS>
And men may talk of kings, and why not I? <EOS>
Second Keeper: <EOS>
Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough. <EOS>
Second Keeper: <EOS>
But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown? <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
My crown is in my heart, not on my head; <EOS>
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones, <EOS>
Nor to be seen: my crown is called content: <EOS>
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy. <EOS>
Second Keeper: <EOS>
Well, if you be a king crown'd with content, <EOS>
Your crown content and you must be contented <EOS>
To go along with us; for as we think, <EOS>
You are the king King Edward hath deposed; <EOS>
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance <EOS>
Will apprehend you as his enemy. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
But did you never swear, and break an oath? <EOS>
Second Keeper: <EOS>
No, never such an oath; nor will not now. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Where did you dwell when I was King of England? <EOS>
Second Keeper: <EOS>
Here in this country, where we now remain. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
I was anointed king at nine months old; <EOS>
My father and my grandfather were kings, <EOS>
And you were sworn true subjects unto me: <EOS>
And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths? <EOS>
First Keeper: <EOS>
No; <EOS>
For we were subjects but while you were king. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man? <EOS>
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear! <EOS>
Look, as I blow this feather from my face, <EOS>
And as the air blows it to me again, <EOS>
Obeying with my wind when I do blow, <EOS>
And yielding to another when it blows, <EOS>
Commanded always by the greater gust; <EOS>
Such is the lightness of you common men. <EOS>
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin <EOS>
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty. <EOS>
Go where you will, the king shall be commanded; <EOS>
And be you kings, command, and I'll obey. <EOS>
First Keeper: <EOS>
We are true subjects to the king, King Edward. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
So would you be again to Henry, <EOS>
If he were seated as King Edward is. <EOS>
First Keeper: <EOS>
We charge you, in God's name, and the king's, <EOS>
To go with us unto the officers. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd: <EOS>
And what God will, that let your king perform; <EOS>
And what he will, I humbly yield unto. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field <EOS>
This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain, <EOS>
His lands then seized on by the conqueror: <EOS>
Her suit is now to repossess those lands; <EOS>
Which we in justice cannot well deny, <EOS>
Because in quarrel of the house of York <EOS>
The worthy gentleman did lose his life. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit; <EOS>
It were dishonour to deny it her. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Widow, we will consider of your suit; <EOS>
And come some other time to know our mind. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay: <EOS>
May it please your highness to resolve me now; <EOS>
And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
How many children hast thou, widow? tell me. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
Three, my most gracious lord. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Now tell me, madam, do you love your children? <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
And would you not do much to do them good? <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
To do them good, I would sustain some harm. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Then get your husband's lands, to do them good. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
Therefore I came unto your majesty. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
I'll tell you how these lands are to be got. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
So shall you bind me to your highness' service. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
What service wilt thou do me, if I give them? <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
What you command, that rests in me to do. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
But you will take exceptions to my boon. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
Why, then I will do what your grace commands. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task? <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
An easy task; 'tis but to love a king. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
I take my leave with many thousand thanks. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense. <EOS>
What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get? <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers; <EOS>
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
No, by my troth, I did not mean such love. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
Why, then you mean not as I thought you did. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
But now you partly may perceive my mind. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
My mind will never grant what I perceive <EOS>
Your highness aims at, if I aim aright. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower; <EOS>
For by that loss I will not purchase them. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
Herein your highness wrongs both them and me. <EOS>
But, mighty lord, this merry inclination <EOS>
Accords not with the sadness of my suit: <EOS>
Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.' <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request; <EOS>
No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord: <EOS>
I am a subject fit to jest withal, <EOS>
But far unfit to be a sovereign. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee <EOS>
I speak no more than what my soul intends; <EOS>
And that is, to enjoy thee for my love. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
And that is more than I will yield unto: <EOS>
I know I am too mean to be your queen, <EOS>
And yet too good to be your concubine. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen. <EOS>
LADY GREY: <EOS>
'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
No more than when my daughters call thee mother. <EOS>
Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children; <EOS>
And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor, <EOS>
Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing <EOS>
To be the father unto many sons. <EOS>
Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
You'll think it strange if I should marry her. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
To whom, my lord? <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Why, Clarence, to myself. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
That would be ten days' wonder at the least. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
That's a day longer than a wonder lasts. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
By so much is the wonder in extremes. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both <EOS>
Her suit is granted for her husband's lands. <EOS>
Nobleman: <EOS>
My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken, <EOS>
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
See that he be convey'd unto the Tower: <EOS>
And go we, brothers, to the man that took him, <EOS>
To question of his apprehension. <EOS>
Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Ay, Edward will use women honourably. <EOS>
Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all, <EOS>
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring, <EOS>
To cross me from the golden time I look for! <EOS>
And yet, between my soul's desire and me-- <EOS>
The lustful Edward's title buried-- <EOS>
Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward, <EOS>
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies, <EOS>
To take their rooms, ere I can place myself: <EOS>
A cold premeditation for my purpose! <EOS>
Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty; <EOS>
Like one that stands upon a promontory, <EOS>
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread, <EOS>
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye, <EOS>
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence, <EOS>
Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way: <EOS>
So do I wish the crown, being so far off; <EOS>
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it; <EOS>
And so I say, I'll cut the causes off, <EOS>
Flattering me with impossibilities. <EOS>
My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much, <EOS>
Unless my hand and strength could equal them. <EOS>
Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard; <EOS>
What other pleasure can the world afford? <EOS>
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap, <EOS>
And deck my body in gay ornaments, <EOS>
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks. <EOS>
O miserable thought! and more unlikely <EOS>
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns! <EOS>
Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb: <EOS>
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws, <EOS>
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe, <EOS>
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub; <EOS>
To make an envious mountain on my back, <EOS>
Where sits deformity to mock my body; <EOS>
To shape my legs of an unequal size; <EOS>
To disproportion me in every part, <EOS>
Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp <EOS>
That carries no impression like the dam. <EOS>
And am I then a man to be beloved? <EOS>
O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought! <EOS>
Then, since this earth affords no joy to me, <EOS>
But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such <EOS>
As are of better person than myself, <EOS>
I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown, <EOS>
And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell, <EOS>
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head <EOS>
Be round impaled with a glorious crown. <EOS>
And yet I know not how to get the crown, <EOS>
For many lives stand between me and home: <EOS>
And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood, <EOS>
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns, <EOS>
Seeking a way and straying from the way; <EOS>
Not knowing how to find the open air, <EOS>
But toiling desperately to find it out,-- <EOS>
Torment myself to catch the English crown: <EOS>
And from that torment I will free myself, <EOS>
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe. <EOS>
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile, <EOS>
And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart, <EOS>
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears, <EOS>
And frame my face to all occasions. <EOS>
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall; <EOS>
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk; <EOS>
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor, <EOS>
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could, <EOS>
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy. <EOS>
I can add colours to the chameleon, <EOS>
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages, <EOS>
And set the murderous Machiavel to school. <EOS>
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown? <EOS>
Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret, <EOS>
Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state <EOS>
And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
No, mighty King of France: now Margaret <EOS>
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve <EOS>
Where kings command. I was, I must confess, <EOS>
Great Albion's queen in former golden days: <EOS>
But now mischance hath trod my title down, <EOS>
And with dishonour laid me on the ground; <EOS>
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune, <EOS>
And to my humble seat conform myself. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears <EOS>
And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself, <EOS>
And sit thee by our side: <EOS>
Yield not thy neck <EOS>
To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind <EOS>
Still ride in triumph over all mischance. <EOS>
Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief; <EOS>
It shall be eased, if France can yield relief. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts <EOS>
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak. <EOS>
Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis, <EOS>
That Henry, sole possessor of my love, <EOS>
Is of a king become a banish'd man, <EOS>
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn; <EOS>
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York <EOS>
Usurps the regal title and the seat <EOS>
Of England's true-anointed lawful king. <EOS>
This is the cause that I, poor Margaret, <EOS>
With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir, <EOS>
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid; <EOS>
And if thou fail us, all our hope is done: <EOS>
Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help; <EOS>
Our people and our peers are both misled, <EOS>
Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight, <EOS>
And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm, <EOS>
While we bethink a means to break it off. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow. <EOS>
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow! <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Ay, now begins a second storm to rise; <EOS>
For this is he that moves both wind and tide. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
From worthy Edward, King of Albion, <EOS>
My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend, <EOS>
I come, in kindness and unfeigned love, <EOS>
First, to do greetings to thy royal person; <EOS>
And then to crave a league of amity; <EOS>
And lastly, to confirm that amity <EOS>
With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant <EOS>
That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister, <EOS>
To England's king in lawful marriage. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak, <EOS>
Before you answer Warwick. His demand <EOS>
Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love, <EOS>
But from deceit bred by necessity; <EOS>
For how can tyrants safely govern home, <EOS>
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance? <EOS>
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice, <EOS>
That Henry liveth still: but were he dead, <EOS>
Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son. <EOS>
Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage <EOS>
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour; <EOS>
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile, <EOS>
Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Injurious Margaret! <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
And why not queen? <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Because thy father Henry did usurp; <EOS>
And thou no more are prince than she is queen. <EOS>
OXFORD: <EOS>
Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt, <EOS>
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain; <EOS>
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth, <EOS>
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest; <EOS>
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth, <EOS>
Who by his prowess conquered all France: <EOS>
From these our Henry lineally descends. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse, <EOS>
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost <EOS>
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten? <EOS>
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that. <EOS>
But for the rest, you tell a pedigree <EOS>
Of threescore and two years; a silly time <EOS>
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth. <EOS>
OXFORD: <EOS>
Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege, <EOS>
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years, <EOS>
And not bewray thy treason with a blush? <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right, <EOS>
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree? <EOS>
For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king. <EOS>
OXFORD: <EOS>
Call him my king by whose injurious doom <EOS>
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere, <EOS>
Was done to death? and more than so, my father, <EOS>
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years, <EOS>
When nature brought him to the door of death? <EOS>
No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm, <EOS>
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
And I the house of York. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford, <EOS>
Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside, <EOS>
While I use further conference with Warwick. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not! <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience, <EOS>
Is Edward your true king? for I were loath <EOS>
To link with him that were not lawful chosen. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
But is he gracious in the people's eye? <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
The more that Henry was unfortunate. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
Then further, all dissembling set aside, <EOS>
Tell me for truth the measure of his love <EOS>
Unto our sister Bona. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Such it seems <EOS>
As may beseem a monarch like himself. <EOS>
Myself have often heard him say and swear <EOS>
That this his love was an eternal plant, <EOS>
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground, <EOS>
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun, <EOS>
Exempt from envy, but not from disdain, <EOS>
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve. <EOS>
BONA: <EOS>
Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine: <EOS>
Yet I confess that often ere this day, <EOS>
When I have heard your king's desert recounted, <EOS>
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's; <EOS>
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn <EOS>
Touching the jointure that your king must make, <EOS>
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised. <EOS>
Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness <EOS>
That Bona shall be wife to the English king. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
To Edward, but not to the English king. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device <EOS>
By this alliance to make void my suit: <EOS>
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
And still is friend to him and Margaret: <EOS>
But if your title to the crown be weak, <EOS>
As may appear by Edward's good success, <EOS>
Then 'tis but reason that I be released <EOS>
From giving aid which late I promised. <EOS>
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand <EOS>
That your estate requires and mine can yield. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease, <EOS>
Where having nothing, nothing can he lose. <EOS>
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen, <EOS>
You have a father able to maintain you; <EOS>
And better 'twere you troubled him than France. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace, <EOS>
Proud setter up and puller down of kings! <EOS>
I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears, <EOS>
Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold <EOS>
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love; <EOS>
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
Warwick, this is some post to us or thee. <EOS>
Post: <EOS>
OXFORD: <EOS>
I like it well that our fair queen and mistress <EOS>
Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled: <EOS>
I hope all's for the best. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
What! has your king married the Lady Grey! <EOS>
And now, to soothe your forgery and his, <EOS>
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience? <EOS>
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France? <EOS>
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
I told your majesty as much before: <EOS>
This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven, <EOS>
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss, <EOS>
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's, <EOS>
No more my king, for he dishonours me, <EOS>
But most himself, if he could see his shame. <EOS>
Did I forget that by the house of York <EOS>
My father came untimely to his death? <EOS>
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece? <EOS>
Did I impale him with the regal crown? <EOS>
Did I put Henry from his native right? <EOS>
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame? <EOS>
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour: <EOS>
And to repair my honour lost for him, <EOS>
I here renounce him and return to Henry. <EOS>
My noble queen, let former grudges pass, <EOS>
And henceforth I am thy true servitor: <EOS>
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona, <EOS>
And replant Henry in his former state. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love; <EOS>
And I forgive and quite forget old faults, <EOS>
And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend, <EOS>
That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us <EOS>
With some few bands of chosen soldiers, <EOS>
I'll undertake to land them on our coast <EOS>
And force the tyrant from his seat by war. <EOS>
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him: <EOS>
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me, <EOS>
He's very likely now to fall from him, <EOS>
For matching more for wanton lust than honour, <EOS>
Or than for strength and safety of our country. <EOS>
BONA: <EOS>
Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged <EOS>
But by thy help to this distressed queen? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live, <EOS>
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair? <EOS>
BONA: <EOS>
My quarrel and this English queen's are one. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's. <EOS>
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved <EOS>
You shall have aid. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Let me give humble thanks for all at once. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
Then, England's messenger, return in post, <EOS>
And tell false Edward, thy supposed king, <EOS>
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers <EOS>
To revel it with him and his new bride: <EOS>
Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal. <EOS>
BONA: <EOS>
Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly, <EOS>
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside, <EOS>
And I am ready to put armour on. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, <EOS>
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long. <EOS>
There's thy reward: be gone. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
But, Warwick, <EOS>
Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men, <EOS>
Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle; <EOS>
And, as occasion serves, this noble queen <EOS>
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply. <EOS>
Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt, <EOS>
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty? <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
This shall assure my constant loyalty, <EOS>
That if our queen and this young prince agree, <EOS>
I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy <EOS>
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion. <EOS>
Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous, <EOS>
Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick; <EOS>
And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable, <EOS>
That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it; <EOS>
And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand. <EOS>
KING LEWIS XI: <EOS>
Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied, <EOS>
And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral, <EOS>
Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet. <EOS>
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance, <EOS>
For mocking marriage with a dame of France. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
I came from Edward as ambassador, <EOS>
But I return his sworn and mortal foe: <EOS>
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me, <EOS>
But dreadful war shall answer his demand. <EOS>
Had he none else to make a stale but me? <EOS>
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow. <EOS>
I was the chief that raised him to the crown, <EOS>
And I'll be chief to bring him down again: <EOS>
Not that I pity Henry's misery, <EOS>
But seek revenge on Edward's mockery. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you <EOS>
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey? <EOS>
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice? <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France; <EOS>
How could he stay till Warwick made return? <EOS>
SOMERSET: <EOS>
My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
And his well-chosen bride. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
I mind to tell him plainly what I think. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice, <EOS>
That you stand pensive, as half malcontent? <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick, <EOS>
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment <EOS>
That they'll take no offence at our abuse. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Suppose they take offence without a cause, <EOS>
They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward, <EOS>
Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
And shall have your will, because our king: <EOS>
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Not I: <EOS>
No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd <EOS>
Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity <EOS>
To sunder them that yoke so well together. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside, <EOS>
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey <EOS>
Should not become my wife and England's queen. <EOS>
And you too, Somerset and Montague, <EOS>
Speak freely what you think. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis <EOS>
Becomes your enemy, for mocking him <EOS>
About the marriage of the Lady Bona. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge, <EOS>
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased <EOS>
By such invention as I can devise? <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance <EOS>
Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth <EOS>
'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Why, knows not Montague that of itself <EOS>
England is safe, if true within itself? <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
But the safer when 'tis back'd with France. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
'Tis better using France than trusting France: <EOS>
Let us be back'd with God and with the seas <EOS>
Which He hath given for fence impregnable, <EOS>
And with their helps only defend ourselves; <EOS>
In them and in ourselves our safety lies. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves <EOS>
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant; <EOS>
And for this once my will shall stand for law. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
And yet methinks your grace hath not done well, <EOS>
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales <EOS>
Unto the brother of your loving bride; <EOS>
She better would have fitted me or Clarence: <EOS>
But in your bride you bury brotherhood. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir <EOS>
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son, <EOS>
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife <EOS>
That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment, <EOS>
Which being shallow, you give me leave <EOS>
To play the broker in mine own behalf; <EOS>
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king, <EOS>
And not be tied unto his brother's will. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
My lords, before it pleased his majesty <EOS>
To raise my state to title of a queen, <EOS>
Do me but right, and you must all confess <EOS>
That I was not ignoble of descent; <EOS>
And meaner than myself have had like fortune. <EOS>
But as this title honours me and mine, <EOS>
So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing, <EOS>
Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns: <EOS>
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee, <EOS>
So long as Edward is thy constant friend, <EOS>
And their true sovereign, whom they must obey? <EOS>
Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too, <EOS>
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands; <EOS>
Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe, <EOS>
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Now, messenger, what letters or what news <EOS>
From France? <EOS>
Post: <EOS>
My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words, <EOS>
But such as I, without your special pardon, <EOS>
Dare not relate. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief, <EOS>
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them. <EOS>
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters? <EOS>
Post: <EOS>
At my depart, these were his very words: <EOS>
'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king, <EOS>
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers <EOS>
To revel it with him and his new bride.' <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry. <EOS>
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage? <EOS>
Post: <EOS>
These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain: <EOS>
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly, <EOS>
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.' <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
I blame not her, she could say little less; <EOS>
She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen? <EOS>
For I have heard that she was there in place. <EOS>
Post: <EOS>
'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done, <EOS>
And I am ready to put armour on.' <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Belike she minds to play the Amazon. <EOS>
But what said Warwick to these injuries? <EOS>
Post: <EOS>
He, more incensed against your majesty <EOS>
Than all the rest, discharged me with these words: <EOS>
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, <EOS>
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.' <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words? <EOS>
Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd: <EOS>
They shall have wars and pay for their presumption. <EOS>
But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret? <EOS>
Post: <EOS>
Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in <EOS>
friendship <EOS>
That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger. <EOS>
Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast, <EOS>
For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter; <EOS>
That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage <EOS>
I may not prove inferior to yourself. <EOS>
You that love me and Warwick, follow me. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick! <EOS>
Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen; <EOS>
And haste is needful in this desperate case. <EOS>
Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf <EOS>
Go levy men, and make prepare for war; <EOS>
They are already, or quickly will be landed: <EOS>
Myself in person will straight follow you. <EOS>
But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague, <EOS>
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest, <EOS>
Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance: <EOS>
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me? <EOS>
If it be so, then both depart to him; <EOS>
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends: <EOS>
But if you mind to hold your true obedience, <EOS>
Give me assurance with some friendly vow, <EOS>
That I may never have you in suspect. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
So God help Montague as he proves true! <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause! <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Why, so! then am I sure of victory. <EOS>
Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour, <EOS>
Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well; <EOS>
The common people by numbers swarm to us. <EOS>
But see where Somerset and Clarence come! <EOS>
Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends? <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Fear not that, my lord. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick; <EOS>
And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice <EOS>
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart <EOS>
Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love; <EOS>
Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother, <EOS>
Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings: <EOS>
But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine. <EOS>
And now what rests but, in night's coverture, <EOS>
Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd, <EOS>
His soldiers lurking in the towns about, <EOS>
And but attended by a simple guard, <EOS>
We may surprise and take him at our pleasure? <EOS>
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy: <EOS>
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede <EOS>
With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents, <EOS>
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds, <EOS>
So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle, <EOS>
At unawares may beat down Edward's guard <EOS>
And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him, <EOS>
For I intend but only to surprise him. <EOS>
You that will follow me to this attempt, <EOS>
Applaud the name of Henry with your leader. <EOS>
Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort: <EOS>
For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George! <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
First Watchman: <EOS>
Come on, my masters, each man take his stand: <EOS>
The king by this is set him down to sleep. <EOS>
Second Watchman: <EOS>
What, will he not to bed? <EOS>
First Watchman: <EOS>
Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow <EOS>
Never to lie and take his natural rest <EOS>
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd. <EOS>
Second Watchman: <EOS>
To-morrow then belike shall be the day, <EOS>
If Warwick be so near as men report. <EOS>
Third Watchman: <EOS>
But say, I pray, what nobleman is that <EOS>
That with the king here resteth in his tent? <EOS>
First Watchman: <EOS>
'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend. <EOS>
Third Watchman: <EOS>
O, is it so? But why commands the king <EOS>
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him, <EOS>
While he himself keeps in the cold field? <EOS>
Second Watchman: <EOS>
'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous. <EOS>
Third Watchman: <EOS>
Ay, but give me worship and quietness; <EOS>
I like it better than a dangerous honour. <EOS>
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands, <EOS>
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him. <EOS>
First Watchman: <EOS>
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage. <EOS>
Second Watchman: <EOS>
Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent, <EOS>
But to defend his person from night-foes? <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
This is his tent; and see where stand his guard. <EOS>
Courage, my masters! honour now or never! <EOS>
But follow me, and Edward shall be ours. <EOS>
First Watchman: <EOS>
Who goes there? <EOS>
Second Watchman: <EOS>
Stay, or thou diest! <EOS>
SOMERSET: <EOS>
What are they that fly there? <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted, <EOS>
Thou call'dst me king. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Ay, but the case is alter'd: <EOS>
When you disgraced me in my embassade, <EOS>
Then I degraded you from being king, <EOS>
And come now to create you Duke of York. <EOS>
Alas! how should you govern any kingdom, <EOS>
That know not how to use ambassadors, <EOS>
Nor how to be contented with one wife, <EOS>
Nor how to use your brothers brotherly, <EOS>
Nor how to study for the people's welfare, <EOS>
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies? <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too? <EOS>
Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down. <EOS>
Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance, <EOS>
Of thee thyself and all thy complices, <EOS>
Edward will always bear himself as king: <EOS>
Though fortune's malice overthrow my state, <EOS>
My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king: <EOS>
But Henry now shall wear the English crown, <EOS>
And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow. <EOS>
My Lord of Somerset, at my request, <EOS>
See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd <EOS>
Unto my brother, Archbishop of York. <EOS>
When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows, <EOS>
I'll follow you, and tell what answer <EOS>
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him. <EOS>
Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
What fates impose, that men must needs abide; <EOS>
It boots not to resist both wind and tide. <EOS>
OXFORD: <EOS>
What now remains, my lords, for us to do <EOS>
But march to London with our soldiers? <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do; <EOS>
To free King Henry from imprisonment <EOS>
And see him seated in the regal throne. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
Madam, what makes you in this sudden change? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn <EOS>
What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward? <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
No, but the loss of his own royal person. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
Then is my sovereign slain? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner, <EOS>
Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard <EOS>
Or by his foe surprised at unawares: <EOS>
And, as I further have to understand, <EOS>
Is new committed to the Bishop of York, <EOS>
Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
These news I must confess are full of grief; <EOS>
Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may: <EOS>
Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay. <EOS>
And I the rather wean me from despair <EOS>
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb: <EOS>
This is it that makes me bridle passion <EOS>
And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross; <EOS>
Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear <EOS>
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs, <EOS>
Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown <EOS>
King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown. <EOS>
RIVERS: <EOS>
But, madam, where is Warwick then become? <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
I am inform'd that he comes towards London, <EOS>
To set the crown once more on Henry's head: <EOS>
Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down, <EOS>
But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,-- <EOS>
For trust not him that hath once broken faith,-- <EOS>
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary, <EOS>
To save at least the heir of Edward's right: <EOS>
There shall I rest secure from force and fraud. <EOS>
Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly: <EOS>
If Warwick take us we are sure to die. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley, <EOS>
Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither, <EOS>
Into this chiefest thicket of the park. <EOS>
Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother, <EOS>
Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands <EOS>
He hath good usage and great liberty, <EOS>
And, often but attended with weak guard, <EOS>
Comes hunting this way to disport himself. <EOS>
I have advertised him by secret means <EOS>
That if about this hour he make his way <EOS>
Under the colour of his usual game, <EOS>
He shall here find his friends with horse and men <EOS>
To set him free from his captivity. <EOS>
Huntsman: <EOS>
This way, my lord; for this way lies the game. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand. <EOS>
Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest, <EOS>
Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Brother, the time and case requireth haste: <EOS>
Your horse stands ready at the park-corner. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
But whither shall we then? <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
To Lynn, my lord, <EOS>
And ship from thence to Flanders. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along? <EOS>
Huntsman: <EOS>
Better do so than tarry and be hang'd. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown; <EOS>
And pray that I may repossess the crown. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Master lieutenant, now that God and friends <EOS>
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat, <EOS>
And turn'd my captive state to liberty, <EOS>
My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys, <EOS>
At our enlargement what are thy due fees? <EOS>
Lieutenant: <EOS>
Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns; <EOS>
But if an humble prayer may prevail, <EOS>
I then crave pardon of your majesty. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
For what, lieutenant? for well using me? <EOS>
Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness, <EOS>
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure; <EOS>
Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds <EOS>
Conceive when after many moody thoughts <EOS>
At last by notes of household harmony <EOS>
They quite forget their loss of liberty. <EOS>
But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free, <EOS>
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee; <EOS>
He was the author, thou the instrument. <EOS>
Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite <EOS>
By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me, <EOS>
And that the people of this blessed land <EOS>
May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars, <EOS>
Warwick, although my head still wear the crown, <EOS>
I here resign my government to thee, <EOS>
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous; <EOS>
And now may seem as wise as virtuous, <EOS>
By spying and avoiding fortune's malice, <EOS>
For few men rightly temper with the stars: <EOS>
Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace, <EOS>
For choosing me when Clarence is in place. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway, <EOS>
To whom the heavens in thy nativity <EOS>
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown, <EOS>
As likely to be blest in peace and war; <EOS>
And therefore I yield thee my free consent. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
And I choose Clarence only for protector. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands: <EOS>
Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts, <EOS>
That no dissension hinder government: <EOS>
I make you both protectors of this land, <EOS>
While I myself will lead a private life <EOS>
And in devotion spend my latter days, <EOS>
To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will? <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
That he consents, if Warwick yield consent; <EOS>
For on thy fortune I repose myself. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content: <EOS>
We'll yoke together, like a double shadow <EOS>
To Henry's body, and supply his place; <EOS>
I mean, in bearing weight of government, <EOS>
While he enjoys the honour and his ease. <EOS>
And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful <EOS>
Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor, <EOS>
And all his lands and goods be confiscate. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
What else? and that succession be determined. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
But, with the first of all your chief affairs, <EOS>
Let me entreat, for I command no more, <EOS>
That Margaret your queen and my son Edward <EOS>
Be sent for, to return from France with speed; <EOS>
For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear <EOS>
My joy of liberty is half eclipsed. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that, <EOS>
Of whom you seem to have so tender care? <EOS>
SOMERSET: <EOS>
My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Come hither, England's hope. <EOS>
If secret powers <EOS>
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts, <EOS>
This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss. <EOS>
His looks are full of peaceful majesty, <EOS>
His head by nature framed to wear a crown, <EOS>
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself <EOS>
Likely in time to bless a regal throne. <EOS>
Make much of him, my lords, for this is he <EOS>
Must help you more than you are hurt by me. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
What news, my friend? <EOS>
Post: <EOS>
That Edward is escaped from your brother, <EOS>
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape? <EOS>
Post: <EOS>
He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester <EOS>
And the Lord Hastings, who attended him <EOS>
In secret ambush on the forest side <EOS>
And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him; <EOS>
For hunting was his daily exercise. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
My brother was too careless of his charge. <EOS>
But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide <EOS>
A salve for any sore that may betide. <EOS>
SOMERSET: <EOS>
My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's; <EOS>
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help, <EOS>
And we shall have more wars before 't be long. <EOS>
As Henry's late presaging prophecy <EOS>
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond, <EOS>
So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts <EOS>
What may befall him, to his harm and ours: <EOS>
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst, <EOS>
Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany, <EOS>
Till storms be past of civil enmity. <EOS>
OXFORD: <EOS>
Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown, <EOS>
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down. <EOS>
SOMERSET: <EOS>
It shall be so; he shall to Brittany. <EOS>
Come, therefore, let's about it speedily. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest, <EOS>
Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends, <EOS>
And says that once more I shall interchange <EOS>
My waned state for Henry's regal crown. <EOS>
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas <EOS>
And brought desired help from Burgundy: <EOS>
What then remains, we being thus arrived <EOS>
From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York, <EOS>
But that we enter, as into our dukedom? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this; <EOS>
For many men that stumble at the threshold <EOS>
Are well foretold that danger lurks within. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us: <EOS>
By fair or foul means we must enter in, <EOS>
For hither will our friends repair to us. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them. <EOS>
Mayor: <EOS>
My lords, we were forewarned of your coming, <EOS>
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves; <EOS>
For now we owe allegiance unto Henry. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
But, master mayor, if Henry be your king, <EOS>
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York. <EOS>
Mayor: <EOS>
True, my good lord; I know you for no less. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom, <EOS>
As being well content with that alone. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt? <EOS>
Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends. <EOS>
Mayor: <EOS>
Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded! <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
The good old man would fain that all were well, <EOS>
So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd, <EOS>
I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade <EOS>
Both him and all his brothers unto reason. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut <EOS>
But in the night or in the time of war. <EOS>
What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys; <EOS>
For Edward will defend the town and thee, <EOS>
And all those friends that deign to follow me. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery, <EOS>
Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms? <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
To help King Edward in his time of storm, <EOS>
As every loyal subject ought to do. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget <EOS>
Our title to the crown and only claim <EOS>
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
Then fare you well, for I will hence again: <EOS>
I came to serve a king and not a duke. <EOS>
Drummer, strike up, and let us march away. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate <EOS>
By what safe means the crown may be recover'd. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
What talk you of debating? in few words, <EOS>
If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king, <EOS>
I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone <EOS>
To keep them back that come to succor you: <EOS>
Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points? <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim: <EOS>
Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns. <EOS>
Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand: <EOS>
The bruit thereof will bring you many friends. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right, <EOS>
And Henry but usurps the diadem. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself; <EOS>
And now will I be Edward's champion. <EOS>
HASTINGS: <EOS>
Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd: <EOS>
Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation. <EOS>
Soldier: <EOS>
Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of <EOS>
England and France, and lord of Ireland, &c. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right, <EOS>
By this I challenge him to single fight. <EOS>
All: <EOS>
Long live Edward the Fourth! <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all: <EOS>
If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness. <EOS>
Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York; <EOS>
And when the morning sun shall raise his car <EOS>
Above the border of this horizon, <EOS>
We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates; <EOS>
For well I wot that Henry is no soldier. <EOS>
Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee <EOS>
To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother! <EOS>
Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick. <EOS>
Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day, <EOS>
And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia, <EOS>
With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders, <EOS>
Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas, <EOS>
And with his troops doth march amain to London; <EOS>
And many giddy people flock to him. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Let's levy men, and beat him back again. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
A little fire is quickly trodden out; <EOS>
Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends, <EOS>
Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war; <EOS>
Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence, <EOS>
Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent, <EOS>
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee: <EOS>
Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham, <EOS>
Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find <EOS>
Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st: <EOS>
And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved, <EOS>
In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends. <EOS>
My sovereign, with the loving citizens, <EOS>
Like to his island girt in with the ocean, <EOS>
Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs, <EOS>
Shall rest in London till we come to him. <EOS>
Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply. <EOS>
Farewell, my sovereign. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate! <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave. <EOS>
OXFORD: <EOS>
And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague, <EOS>
And all at once, once more a happy farewell. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Here at the palace I will rest awhile. <EOS>
Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship? <EOS>
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field <EOS>
Should not be able to encounter mine. <EOS>
EXETER: <EOS>
The doubt is that he will seduce the rest. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame: <EOS>
I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands, <EOS>
Nor posted off their suits with slow delays; <EOS>
My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds, <EOS>
My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs, <EOS>
My mercy dried their water-flowing tears; <EOS>
I have not been desirous of their wealth, <EOS>
Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies. <EOS>
Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd: <EOS>
Then why should they love Edward more than me? <EOS>
No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace: <EOS>
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb, <EOS>
The lamb will never cease to follow him. <EOS>
EXETER: <EOS>
Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these? <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence; <EOS>
And once again proclaim us King of England. <EOS>
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow: <EOS>
Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry, <EOS>
And swell so much the higher by their ebb. <EOS>
Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak. <EOS>
And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course <EOS>
Where peremptory Warwick now remains: <EOS>
The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay, <EOS>
Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Away betimes, before his forces join, <EOS>
And take the great-grown traitor unawares: <EOS>
Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford? <EOS>
How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow? <EOS>
First Messenger: <EOS>
By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
How far off is our brother Montague? <EOS>
Where is the post that came from Montague? <EOS>
Second Messenger: <EOS>
By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Say, Somerville, what says my loving son? <EOS>
And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now? <EOS>
SOMERSET: <EOS>
At Southam I did leave him with his forces, <EOS>
And do expect him here some two hours hence. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum. <EOS>
SOMERSET: <EOS>
It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies: <EOS>
The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends. <EOS>
SOMERSET: <EOS>
They are at hand, and you shall quickly know. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
See how the surly Warwick mans the wall! <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come? <EOS>
Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced, <EOS>
That we could hear no news of his repair? <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates, <EOS>
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee, <EOS>
Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy? <EOS>
And he shall pardon thee these outrages. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence, <EOS>
Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own, <EOS>
Call Warwick patron and be penitent? <EOS>
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I thought, at least, he would have said the king; <EOS>
Or did he make the jest against his will? <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give: <EOS>
I'll do thee service for so good a gift. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight: <EOS>
And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again; <EOS>
And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner: <EOS>
And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this: <EOS>
What is the body when the head is off? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast, <EOS>
But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten, <EOS>
The king was slily finger'd from the deck! <EOS>
You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace, <EOS>
And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower. <EOS>
EDWARD: <EOS>
'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down: <EOS>
Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow, <EOS>
And with the other fling it at thy face, <EOS>
Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend, <EOS>
This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair <EOS>
Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off, <EOS>
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood, <EOS>
'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.' <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes! <EOS>
OXFORD: <EOS>
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
The gates are open, let us enter too. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
So other foes may set upon our backs. <EOS>
Stand we in good array; for they no doubt <EOS>
Will issue out again and bid us battle: <EOS>
If not, the city being but of small defence, <EOS>
We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help. <EOS>
MONTAGUE: <EOS>
Montague, Montague, for Lancaster! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason <EOS>
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
The harder match'd, the greater victory: <EOS>
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest. <EOS>
SOMERSET: <EOS>
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset, <EOS>
Have sold their lives unto the house of York; <EOS>
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along, <EOS>
Of force enough to bid his brother battle; <EOS>
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails <EOS>
More than the nature of a brother's love! <EOS>
Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Father of Warwick, know you what this means? <EOS>
Look here, I throw my infamy at thee <EOS>
I will not ruinate my father's house, <EOS>
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together, <EOS>
And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick, <EOS>
That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural, <EOS>
To bend the fatal instruments of war <EOS>
Against his brother and his lawful king? <EOS>
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath: <EOS>
To keep that oath were more impiety <EOS>
Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter. <EOS>
I am so sorry for my trespass made <EOS>
That, to deserve well at my brother's hands, <EOS>
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe, <EOS>
With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee-- <EOS>
As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad-- <EOS>
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me. <EOS>
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee, <EOS>
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks. <EOS>
Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends: <EOS>
And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults, <EOS>
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved, <EOS>
Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
O passing traitor, perjured and unjust! <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight? <EOS>
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears? <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence! <EOS>
I will away towards Barnet presently, <EOS>
And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way. <EOS>
Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory! <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear; <EOS>
For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all. <EOS>
Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee, <EOS>
That Warwick's bones may keep thine company. <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe, <EOS>
And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick? <EOS>
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows, <EOS>
My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows. <EOS>
That I must yield my body to the earth <EOS>
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe. <EOS>
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge, <EOS>
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle, <EOS>
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept, <EOS>
Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree <EOS>
And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind. <EOS>
These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil, <EOS>
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun, <EOS>
To search the secret treasons of the world: <EOS>
The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood, <EOS>
Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres; <EOS>
For who lived king, but I could dig his grave? <EOS>
And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow? <EOS>
Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood! <EOS>
My parks, my walks, my manors that I had. <EOS>
Even now forsake me, and of all my lands <EOS>
Is nothing left me but my body's length. <EOS>
Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust? <EOS>
And, live we how we can, yet die we must. <EOS>
SOMERSET: <EOS>
Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are. <EOS>
We might recover all our loss again; <EOS>
The queen from France hath brought a puissant power: <EOS>
Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly! <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague, <EOS>
If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand. <EOS>
And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile! <EOS>
Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst, <EOS>
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood <EOS>
That glues my lips and will not let me speak. <EOS>
Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead. <EOS>
SOMERSET: <EOS>
Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last; <EOS>
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick, <EOS>
And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.' <EOS>
And more he would have said, and more he spoke, <EOS>
Which sounded like a clamour in a vault, <EOS>
That mought not be distinguished; but at last <EOS>
I well might hear, delivered with a groan, <EOS>
'O, farewell, Warwick!' <EOS>
WARWICK: <EOS>
Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves; <EOS>
For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven. <EOS>
OXFORD: <EOS>
Away, away, to meet the queen's great power! <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course, <EOS>
And we are graced with wreaths of victory. <EOS>
But, in the midst of this bright-shining day, <EOS>
I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud, <EOS>
That will encounter with our glorious sun, <EOS>
Ere he attain his easeful western bed: <EOS>
I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen <EOS>
Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast <EOS>
And, as we hear, march on to fight with us. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud <EOS>
And blow it to the source from whence it came: <EOS>
The very beams will dry those vapours up, <EOS>
For every cloud engenders not a storm. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong, <EOS>
And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her: <EOS>
If she have time to breathe be well assured <EOS>
Her faction will be full as strong as ours. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
We are advertised by our loving friends <EOS>
That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury: <EOS>
We, having now the best at Barnet field, <EOS>
Will thither straight, for willingness rids way; <EOS>
And, as we march, our strength will be augmented <EOS>
In every county as we go along. <EOS>
Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss, <EOS>
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms. <EOS>
What though the mast be now blown overboard, <EOS>
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost, <EOS>
And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood? <EOS>
Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he <EOS>
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad <EOS>
With tearful eyes add water to the sea <EOS>
And give more strength to that which hath too much, <EOS>
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock, <EOS>
Which industry and courage might have saved? <EOS>
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this! <EOS>
Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that? <EOS>
And Montague our topmost; what of him? <EOS>
Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these? <EOS>
Why, is not Oxford here another anchor? <EOS>
And Somerset another goodly mast? <EOS>
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings? <EOS>
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I <EOS>
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge? <EOS>
We will not from the helm to sit and weep, <EOS>
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no, <EOS>
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck. <EOS>
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair. <EOS>
And what is Edward but ruthless sea? <EOS>
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit? <EOS>
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock? <EOS>
All these the enemies to our poor bark. <EOS>
Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while! <EOS>
Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink: <EOS>
Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off, <EOS>
Or else you famish; that's a threefold death. <EOS>
This speak I, lords, to let you understand, <EOS>
If case some one of you would fly from us, <EOS>
That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers <EOS>
More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks. <EOS>
Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided <EOS>
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit <EOS>
Should, if a coward heard her speak these words, <EOS>
Infuse his breast with magnanimity <EOS>
And make him, naked, foil a man at arms. <EOS>
I speak not this as doubting any here <EOS>
For did I but suspect a fearful man <EOS>
He should have leave to go away betimes, <EOS>
Lest in our need he might infect another <EOS>
And make him of like spirit to himself. <EOS>
If any such be here--as God forbid!-- <EOS>
Let him depart before we need his help. <EOS>
OXFORD: <EOS>
Women and children of so high a courage, <EOS>
And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame. <EOS>
O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather <EOS>
Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live <EOS>
To bear his image and renew his glories! <EOS>
SOMERSET: <EOS>
And he that will not fight for such a hope. <EOS>
Go home to bed, and like the owl by day, <EOS>
If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else. <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand. <EOS>
Ready to fight; therefore be resolute. <EOS>
OXFORD: <EOS>
I thought no less: it is his policy <EOS>
To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided. <EOS>
SOMERSET: <EOS>
But he's deceived; we are in readiness. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness. <EOS>
OXFORD: <EOS>
Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood, <EOS>
Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength, <EOS>
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night. <EOS>
I need not add more fuel to your fire, <EOS>
For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out <EOS>
Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords! <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say <EOS>
My tears gainsay; for every word I speak, <EOS>
Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes. <EOS>
Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign, <EOS>
Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd, <EOS>
His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain, <EOS>
His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent; <EOS>
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil. <EOS>
You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords, <EOS>
Be valiant and give signal to the fight. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Now here a period of tumultuous broils. <EOS>
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight: <EOS>
For Somerset, off with his guilty head. <EOS>
Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak. <EOS>
OXFORD: <EOS>
For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words. <EOS>
SOMERSET: <EOS>
Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
So part we sadly in this troublous world, <EOS>
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward <EOS>
Shall have a high reward, and he his life? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes! <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak. <EOS>
What! can so young a thorn begin to prick? <EOS>
Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make <EOS>
For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects, <EOS>
And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to? <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York! <EOS>
Suppose that I am now my father's mouth; <EOS>
Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou, <EOS>
Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee, <EOS>
Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Ah, that thy father had been so resolved! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
That you might still have worn the petticoat, <EOS>
And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
Let AEsop fable in a winter's night; <EOS>
His currish riddles sort not with this place. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
For God's sake, take away this captive scold. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert. <EOS>
PRINCE EDWARD: <EOS>
I know my duty; you are all undutiful: <EOS>
Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George, <EOS>
And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all <EOS>
I am your better, traitors as ye are: <EOS>
And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Take that, thou likeness of this railer here. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
And there's for twitting me with perjury. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
O, kill me too! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Marry, and shall. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Why should she live, to fill the world with words? <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother; <EOS>
I'll hence to London on a serious matter: <EOS>
Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
What? what? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
The Tower, the Tower. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy! <EOS>
Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers! <EOS>
They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all, <EOS>
Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame, <EOS>
If this foul deed were by to equal it: <EOS>
He was a man; this, in respect, a child: <EOS>
And men ne'er spend their fury on a child. <EOS>
What's worse than murderer, that I may name it? <EOS>
No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak: <EOS>
And I will speak, that so my heart may burst. <EOS>
Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals! <EOS>
How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd! <EOS>
You have no children, butchers! if you had, <EOS>
The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse: <EOS>
But if you ever chance to have a child, <EOS>
Look in his youth to have him so cut off <EOS>
As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince! <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here, <EOS>
Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death: <EOS>
What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it? <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself: <EOS>
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity. <EOS>
What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher, <EOS>
Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou? <EOS>
Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed; <EOS>
Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence. <EOS>
QUEEN MARGARET: <EOS>
So come to you and yours, as to this Prince! <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Where's Richard gone? <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
To London, all in post; and, as I guess, <EOS>
To make a bloody supper in the Tower. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head. <EOS>
Now march we hence: discharge the common sort <EOS>
With pay and thanks, and let's away to London <EOS>
And see our gentle queen how well she fares: <EOS>
By this, I hope, she hath a son for me. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard? <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather; <EOS>
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better: <EOS>
'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike, <EOS>
And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.' <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf; <EOS>
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece <EOS>
And next his throat unto the butcher's knife. <EOS>
What scene of death hath Roscius now to act? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind; <EOS>
The thief doth fear each bush an officer. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
The bird that hath been limed in a bush, <EOS>
With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush; <EOS>
And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird, <EOS>
Have now the fatal object in my eye <EOS>
Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete, <EOS>
That taught his son the office of a fowl! <EOS>
An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus; <EOS>
Thy father, Minos, that denied our course; <EOS>
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy <EOS>
Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea <EOS>
Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life. <EOS>
Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words! <EOS>
My breast can better brook thy dagger's point <EOS>
Than can my ears that tragic history. <EOS>
But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life? <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Think'st thou I am an executioner? <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
A persecutor, I am sure, thou art: <EOS>
If murdering innocents be executing, <EOS>
Why, then thou art an executioner. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume, <EOS>
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine. <EOS>
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand, <EOS>
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear, <EOS>
And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's, <EOS>
And many an orphan's water-standing eye-- <EOS>
Men for their sons, wives for their husbands, <EOS>
And orphans for their parents timeless death-- <EOS>
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born. <EOS>
The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign; <EOS>
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time; <EOS>
Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees; <EOS>
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top, <EOS>
And chattering pies in dismal discords sung. <EOS>
Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain, <EOS>
And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope, <EOS>
To wit, an indigested and deformed lump, <EOS>
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree. <EOS>
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born, <EOS>
To signify thou camest to bite the world: <EOS>
And, if the rest be true which I have heard, <EOS>
Thou camest-- <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech: <EOS>
For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd. <EOS>
KING HENRY VI: <EOS>
Ay, and for much more slaughter after this. <EOS>
God forgive my sins, and pardon thee! <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster <EOS>
Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted. <EOS>
See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death! <EOS>
O, may such purple tears be alway shed <EOS>
From those that wish the downfall of our house! <EOS>
If any spark of life be yet remaining, <EOS>
Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither: <EOS>
I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear. <EOS>
Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of; <EOS>
For I have often heard my mother say <EOS>
I came into the world with my legs forward: <EOS>
Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste, <EOS>
And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right? <EOS>
The midwife wonder'd and the women cried <EOS>
'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!' <EOS>
And so I was; which plainly signified <EOS>
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog. <EOS>
Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so, <EOS>
Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it. <EOS>
I have no brother, I am like no brother; <EOS>
And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine, <EOS>
Be resident in men like one another <EOS>
And not in me: I am myself alone. <EOS>
Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light: <EOS>
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee; <EOS>
For I will buz abroad such prophecies <EOS>
That Edward shall be fearful of his life, <EOS>
And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death. <EOS>
King Henry and the prince his son are gone: <EOS>
Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest, <EOS>
Counting myself but bad till I be best. <EOS>
I'll throw thy body in another room <EOS>
And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom. <EOS>
3 KING HENRY VI <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Once more we sit in England's royal throne, <EOS>
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies. <EOS>
What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn, <EOS>
Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride! <EOS>
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd <EOS>
For hardy and undoubted champions; <EOS>
Two Cliffords, as the father and the son, <EOS>
And two Northumberlands; two braver men <EOS>
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound; <EOS>
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague, <EOS>
That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion <EOS>
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd. <EOS>
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat <EOS>
And made our footstool of security. <EOS>
Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy. <EOS>
Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself <EOS>
Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night, <EOS>
Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat, <EOS>
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace; <EOS>
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen; <EOS>
And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
The duty that I owe unto your majesty <EOS>
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe. <EOS>
QUEEN ELIZABETH: <EOS>
Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks. <EOS>
GLOUCESTER: <EOS>
And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st, <EOS>
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Now am I seated as my soul delights, <EOS>
Having my country's peace and brothers' loves. <EOS>
CLARENCE: <EOS>
What will your grace have done with Margaret? <EOS>
Reignier, her father, to the king of France <EOS>
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem, <EOS>
And hither have they sent it for her ransom. <EOS>
KING EDWARD IV: <EOS>
Away with her, and waft her hence to France. <EOS>
And now what rests but that we spend the time <EOS>
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows, <EOS>
Such as befits the pleasure of the court? <EOS>
Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy! <EOS>
For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy. <EOS>
ARCHIDAMUS: <EOS>
If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on <EOS>
the like occasion whereon my services are now on <EOS>
foot, you shall see, as I have said, great <EOS>
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia <EOS>
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him. <EOS>
ARCHIDAMUS: <EOS>
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be <EOS>
justified in our loves; for indeed-- <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Beseech you,-- <EOS>
ARCHIDAMUS: <EOS>
Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: <EOS>
we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know <EOS>
not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks, <EOS>
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience, <EOS>
may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse <EOS>
us. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely. <EOS>
ARCHIDAMUS: <EOS>
Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me <EOS>
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia. <EOS>
They were trained together in their childhoods; and <EOS>
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection, <EOS>
which cannot choose but branch now. Since their <EOS>
more mature dignities and royal necessities made <EOS>
separation of their society, their encounters, <EOS>
though not personal, have been royally attorneyed <EOS>
with interchange of gifts, letters, loving <EOS>
embassies; that they have seemed to be together, <EOS>
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and <EOS>
embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed <EOS>
winds. The heavens continue their loves! <EOS>
ARCHIDAMUS: <EOS>
I think there is not in the world either malice or <EOS>
matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable <EOS>
comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a <EOS>
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came <EOS>
into my note. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it <EOS>
is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the <EOS>
subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on <EOS>
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to <EOS>
see him a man. <EOS>
ARCHIDAMUS: <EOS>
Would they else be content to die? <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should <EOS>
desire to live. <EOS>
ARCHIDAMUS: <EOS>
If the king had no son, they would desire to live <EOS>
on crutches till he had one. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Nine changes of the watery star hath been <EOS>
The shepherd's note since we have left our throne <EOS>
Without a burthen: time as long again <EOS>
Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks; <EOS>
And yet we should, for perpetuity, <EOS>
Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher, <EOS>
Yet standing in rich place, I multiply <EOS>
With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe <EOS>
That go before it. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Stay your thanks a while; <EOS>
And pay them when you part. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Sir, that's to-morrow. <EOS>
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance <EOS>
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow <EOS>
No sneaping winds at home, to make us say <EOS>
'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd <EOS>
To tire your royalty. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
We are tougher, brother, <EOS>
Than you can put us to't. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
No longer stay. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
One seven-night longer. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Very sooth, to-morrow. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
We'll part the time between's then; and in that <EOS>
I'll no gainsaying. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Press me not, beseech you, so. <EOS>
There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world, <EOS>
So soon as yours could win me: so it should now, <EOS>
Were there necessity in your request, although <EOS>
'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs <EOS>
Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder <EOS>
Were in your love a whip to me; my stay <EOS>
To you a charge and trouble: to save both, <EOS>
Farewell, our brother. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Tongue-tied, our queen? <EOS>
speak you. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until <EOS>
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir, <EOS>
Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure <EOS>
All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction <EOS>
The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him, <EOS>
He's beat from his best ward. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Well said, Hermione. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong: <EOS>
But let him say so then, and let him go; <EOS>
But let him swear so, and he shall not stay, <EOS>
We'll thwack him hence with distaffs. <EOS>
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure <EOS>
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia <EOS>
You take my lord, I'll give him my commission <EOS>
To let him there a month behind the gest <EOS>
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes, <EOS>
I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind <EOS>
What lady-she her lord. You'll stay? <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
No, madam. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Nay, but you will? <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
I may not, verily. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Verily! <EOS>
You put me off with limber vows; but I, <EOS>
Though you would seek to unsphere the <EOS>
stars with oaths, <EOS>
Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily, <EOS>
You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's <EOS>
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet? <EOS>
Force me to keep you as a prisoner, <EOS>
Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees <EOS>
When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you? <EOS>
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,' <EOS>
One of them you shall be. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Your guest, then, madam: <EOS>
To be your prisoner should import offending; <EOS>
Which is for me less easy to commit <EOS>
Than you to punish. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Not your gaoler, then, <EOS>
But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you <EOS>
Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys: <EOS>
You were pretty lordings then? <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
We were, fair queen, <EOS>
Two lads that thought there was no more behind <EOS>
But such a day to-morrow as to-day, <EOS>
And to be boy eternal. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Was not my lord <EOS>
The verier wag o' the two? <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun, <EOS>
And bleat the one at the other: what we changed <EOS>
Was innocence for innocence; we knew not <EOS>
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd <EOS>
That any did. Had we pursued that life, <EOS>
And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd <EOS>
With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven <EOS>
Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd <EOS>
Hereditary ours. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
By this we gather <EOS>
You have tripp'd since. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
O my most sacred lady! <EOS>
Temptations have since then been born to's; for <EOS>
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl; <EOS>
Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes <EOS>
Of my young play-fellow. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Grace to boot! <EOS>
Of this make no conclusion, lest you say <EOS>
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on; <EOS>
The offences we have made you do we'll answer, <EOS>
If you first sinn'd with us and that with us <EOS>
You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not <EOS>
With any but with us. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Is he won yet? <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
He'll stay my lord. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
At my request he would not. <EOS>
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest <EOS>
To better purpose. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Never? <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Never, but once. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
What! have I twice said well? when was't before? <EOS>
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's <EOS>
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless <EOS>
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that. <EOS>
Our praises are our wages: you may ride's <EOS>
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere <EOS>
With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal: <EOS>
My last good deed was to entreat his stay: <EOS>
What was my first? it has an elder sister, <EOS>
Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace! <EOS>
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when? <EOS>
Nay, let me have't; I long. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Why, that was when <EOS>
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death, <EOS>
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand <EOS>
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter <EOS>
'I am yours for ever.' <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
'Tis grace indeed. <EOS>
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice: <EOS>
The one for ever earn'd a royal husband; <EOS>
The other for some while a friend. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
MAMILLIUS: <EOS>
Ay, my good lord. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
I' fecks! <EOS>
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast <EOS>
smutch'd thy nose? <EOS>
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain, <EOS>
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain: <EOS>
And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf <EOS>
Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling <EOS>
Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf! <EOS>
Art thou my calf? <EOS>
MAMILLIUS: <EOS>
Yes, if you will, my lord. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have, <EOS>
To be full like me: yet they say we are <EOS>
Almost as like as eggs; women say so, <EOS>
That will say anything but were they false <EOS>
As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false <EOS>
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes <EOS>
No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true <EOS>
To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page, <EOS>
Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain! <EOS>
Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?-- <EOS>
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre: <EOS>
Thou dost make possible things not so held, <EOS>
Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?-- <EOS>
With what's unreal thou coactive art, <EOS>
And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent <EOS>
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost, <EOS>
And that beyond commission, and I find it, <EOS>
And that to the infection of my brains <EOS>
And hardening of my brows. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
What means Sicilia? <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
He something seems unsettled. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
How, my lord! <EOS>
What cheer? how is't with you, best brother? <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction <EOS>
Are you moved, my lord? <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
No, in good earnest. <EOS>
How sometimes nature will betray its folly, <EOS>
Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime <EOS>
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines <EOS>
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil <EOS>
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd, <EOS>
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled, <EOS>
Lest it should bite its master, and so prove, <EOS>
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous: <EOS>
How like, methought, I then was to this kernel, <EOS>
This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend, <EOS>
Will you take eggs for money? <EOS>
MAMILLIUS: <EOS>
No, my lord, I'll fight. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother, <EOS>
Are you so fond of your young prince as we <EOS>
Do seem to be of ours? <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
If at home, sir, <EOS>
He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter, <EOS>
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy, <EOS>
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all: <EOS>
He makes a July's day short as December, <EOS>
And with his varying childness cures in me <EOS>
Thoughts that would thick my blood. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
So stands this squire <EOS>
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord, <EOS>
And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione, <EOS>
How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome; <EOS>
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap: <EOS>
Next to thyself and my young rover, he's <EOS>
Apparent to my heart. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
If you would seek us, <EOS>
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there? <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found, <EOS>
Be you beneath the sky. <EOS>
I am angling now, <EOS>
Though you perceive me not how I give line. <EOS>
Go to, go to! <EOS>
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him! <EOS>
And arms her with the boldness of a wife <EOS>
To her allowing husband! <EOS>
Gone already! <EOS>
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and <EOS>
ears a fork'd one! <EOS>
Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I <EOS>
Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue <EOS>
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour <EOS>
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play. <EOS>
There have been, <EOS>
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now; <EOS>
And many a man there is, even at this present, <EOS>
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm, <EOS>
That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence <EOS>
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by <EOS>
Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't <EOS>
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd, <EOS>
As mine, against their will. Should all despair <EOS>
That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind <EOS>
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none; <EOS>
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike <EOS>
Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it, <EOS>
From east, west, north and south: be it concluded, <EOS>
No barricado for a belly; know't; <EOS>
It will let in and out the enemy <EOS>
With bag and baggage: many thousand on's <EOS>
Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy! <EOS>
MAMILLIUS: <EOS>
I am like you, they say. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there? <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Ay, my good lord. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man. <EOS>
Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
You had much ado to make his anchor hold: <EOS>
When you cast out, it still came home. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Didst note it? <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
He would not stay at your petitions: made <EOS>
His business more material. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Didst perceive it? <EOS>
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding <EOS>
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone, <EOS>
When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo, <EOS>
That he did stay? <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
At the good queen's entreaty. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent <EOS>
But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken <EOS>
By any understanding pate but thine? <EOS>
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in <EOS>
More than the common blocks: not noted, is't, <EOS>
But of the finer natures? by some severals <EOS>
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes <EOS>
Perchance are to this business purblind? say. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Business, my lord! I think most understand <EOS>
Bohemia stays here longer. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Ha! <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Stays here longer. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Ay, but why? <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties <EOS>
Of our most gracious mistress. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Satisfy! <EOS>
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy! <EOS>
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo, <EOS>
With all the nearest things to my heart, as well <EOS>
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou <EOS>
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed <EOS>
Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been <EOS>
Deceived in thy integrity, deceived <EOS>
In that which seems so. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Be it forbid, my lord! <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or, <EOS>
If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward, <EOS>
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining <EOS>
From course required; or else thou must be counted <EOS>
A servant grafted in my serious trust <EOS>
And therein negligent; or else a fool <EOS>
That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn, <EOS>
And takest it all for jest. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
My gracious lord, <EOS>
I may be negligent, foolish and fearful; <EOS>
In every one of these no man is free, <EOS>
But that his negligence, his folly, fear, <EOS>
Among the infinite doings of the world, <EOS>
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord, <EOS>
If ever I were wilful-negligent, <EOS>
It was my folly; if industriously <EOS>
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence, <EOS>
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful <EOS>
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted, <EOS>
Where of the execution did cry out <EOS>
Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear <EOS>
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord, <EOS>
Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty <EOS>
Is never free of. But, beseech your grace, <EOS>
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass <EOS>
By its own visage: if I then deny it, <EOS>
'Tis none of mine. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Ha' not you seen, Camillo,-- <EOS>
But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass <EOS>
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,-- <EOS>
For to a vision so apparent rumour <EOS>
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation <EOS>
Resides not in that man that does not think,-- <EOS>
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess, <EOS>
Or else be impudently negative, <EOS>
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say <EOS>
My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name <EOS>
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to <EOS>
Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
I would not be a stander-by to hear <EOS>
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without <EOS>
My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart, <EOS>
You never spoke what did become you less <EOS>
Than this; which to reiterate were sin <EOS>
As deep as that, though true. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Is whispering nothing? <EOS>
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses? <EOS>
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career <EOS>
Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible <EOS>
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot? <EOS>
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift? <EOS>
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes <EOS>
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only, <EOS>
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing? <EOS>
Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing; <EOS>
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing; <EOS>
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings, <EOS>
If this be nothing. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Good my lord, be cured <EOS>
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes; <EOS>
For 'tis most dangerous. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Say it be, 'tis true. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
No, no, my lord. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
It is; you lie, you lie: <EOS>
I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee, <EOS>
Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave, <EOS>
Or else a hovering temporizer, that <EOS>
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil, <EOS>
Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver <EOS>
Infected as her life, she would not live <EOS>
The running of one glass. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Who does infect her? <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging <EOS>
About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I <EOS>
Had servants true about me, that bare eyes <EOS>
To see alike mine honour as their profits, <EOS>
Their own particular thrifts, they would do that <EOS>
Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou, <EOS>
His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form <EOS>
Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see <EOS>
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven, <EOS>
How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup, <EOS>
To give mine enemy a lasting wink; <EOS>
Which draught to me were cordial. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Sir, my lord, <EOS>
I could do this, and that with no rash potion, <EOS>
But with a lingering dram that should not work <EOS>
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot <EOS>
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress, <EOS>
So sovereignly being honourable. <EOS>
I have loved thee,-- <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Make that thy question, and go rot! <EOS>
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled, <EOS>
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully <EOS>
The purity and whiteness of my sheets, <EOS>
Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted <EOS>
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps, <EOS>
Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son, <EOS>
Who I do think is mine and love as mine, <EOS>
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this? <EOS>
Could man so blench? <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
I must believe you, sir: <EOS>
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't; <EOS>
Provided that, when he's removed, your highness <EOS>
Will take again your queen as yours at first, <EOS>
Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing <EOS>
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms <EOS>
Known and allied to yours. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Thou dost advise me <EOS>
Even so as I mine own course have set down: <EOS>
I'll give no blemish to her honour, none. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
My lord, <EOS>
Go then; and with a countenance as clear <EOS>
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia <EOS>
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer: <EOS>
If from me he have wholesome beverage, <EOS>
Account me not your servant. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
This is all: <EOS>
Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart; <EOS>
Do't not, thou split'st thine own. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
I'll do't, my lord. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
O miserable lady! But, for me, <EOS>
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner <EOS>
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't <EOS>
Is the obedience to a master, one <EOS>
Who in rebellion with himself will have <EOS>
All that are his so too. To do this deed, <EOS>
Promotion follows. If I could find example <EOS>
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings <EOS>
And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since <EOS>
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one, <EOS>
Let villany itself forswear't. I must <EOS>
Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain <EOS>
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now! <EOS>
Here comes Bohemia. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
This is strange: methinks <EOS>
My favour here begins to warp. Not speak? <EOS>
Good day, Camillo. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Hail, most royal sir! <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
What is the news i' the court? <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
None rare, my lord. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
The king hath on him such a countenance <EOS>
As he had lost some province and a region <EOS>
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him <EOS>
With customary compliment; when he, <EOS>
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling <EOS>
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and <EOS>
So leaves me to consider what is breeding <EOS>
That changeth thus his manners. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
I dare not know, my lord. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not? <EOS>
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts; <EOS>
For, to yourself, what you do know, you must. <EOS>
And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo, <EOS>
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror <EOS>
Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be <EOS>
A party in this alteration, finding <EOS>
Myself thus alter'd with 't. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
There is a sickness <EOS>
Which puts some of us in distemper, but <EOS>
I cannot name the disease; and it is caught <EOS>
Of you that yet are well. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
How! caught of me! <EOS>
Make me not sighted like the basilisk: <EOS>
I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better <EOS>
By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,-- <EOS>
As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto <EOS>
Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns <EOS>
Our gentry than our parents' noble names, <EOS>
In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you, <EOS>
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge <EOS>
Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not <EOS>
In ignorant concealment. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
I may not answer. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
A sickness caught of me, and yet I well! <EOS>
I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo, <EOS>
I conjure thee, by all the parts of man <EOS>
Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least <EOS>
Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare <EOS>
What incidency thou dost guess of harm <EOS>
Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near; <EOS>
Which way to be prevented, if to be; <EOS>
If not, how best to bear it. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Sir, I will tell you; <EOS>
Since I am charged in honour and by him <EOS>
That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel, <EOS>
Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as <EOS>
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me <EOS>
Cry lost, and so good night! <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
On, good Camillo. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
I am appointed him to murder you. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
By whom, Camillo? <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
By the king. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
For what? <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears, <EOS>
As he had seen't or been an instrument <EOS>
To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen <EOS>
Forbiddenly. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
O, then my best blood turn <EOS>
To an infected jelly and my name <EOS>
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best! <EOS>
Turn then my freshest reputation to <EOS>
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril <EOS>
Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd, <EOS>
Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection <EOS>
That e'er was heard or read! <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Swear his thought over <EOS>
By each particular star in heaven and <EOS>
By all their influences, you may as well <EOS>
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon <EOS>
As or by oath remove or counsel shake <EOS>
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation <EOS>
Is piled upon his faith and will continue <EOS>
The standing of his body. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
How should this grow? <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to <EOS>
Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born. <EOS>
If therefore you dare trust my honesty, <EOS>
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you <EOS>
Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night! <EOS>
Your followers I will whisper to the business, <EOS>
And will by twos and threes at several posterns <EOS>
Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put <EOS>
My fortunes to your service, which are here <EOS>
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain; <EOS>
For, by the honour of my parents, I <EOS>
Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove, <EOS>
I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer <EOS>
Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon <EOS>
His execution sworn. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
I do believe thee: <EOS>
I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand: <EOS>
Be pilot to me and thy places shall <EOS>
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and <EOS>
My people did expect my hence departure <EOS>
Two days ago. This jealousy <EOS>
Is for a precious creature: as she's rare, <EOS>
Must it be great, and as his person's mighty, <EOS>
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive <EOS>
He is dishonour'd by a man which ever <EOS>
Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must <EOS>
In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me: <EOS>
Good expedition be my friend, and comfort <EOS>
The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing <EOS>
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo; <EOS>
I will respect thee as a father if <EOS>
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
It is in mine authority to command <EOS>
The keys of all the posterns: please your highness <EOS>
To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Take the boy to you: he so troubles me, <EOS>
'Tis past enduring. <EOS>
First Lady: <EOS>
Come, my gracious lord, <EOS>
Shall I be your playfellow? <EOS>
MAMILLIUS: <EOS>
No, I'll none of you. <EOS>
First Lady: <EOS>
Why, my sweet lord? <EOS>
MAMILLIUS: <EOS>
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if <EOS>
I were a baby still. I love you better. <EOS>
Second Lady: <EOS>
And why so, my lord? <EOS>
MAMILLIUS: <EOS>
Not for because <EOS>
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say, <EOS>
Become some women best, so that there be not <EOS>
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle <EOS>
Or a half-moon made with a pen. <EOS>
Second Lady: <EOS>
Who taught you this? <EOS>
MAMILLIUS: <EOS>
I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now <EOS>
What colour are your eyebrows? <EOS>
First Lady: <EOS>
Blue, my lord. <EOS>
MAMILLIUS: <EOS>
Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose <EOS>
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows. <EOS>
First Lady: <EOS>
Hark ye; <EOS>
The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall <EOS>
Present our services to a fine new prince <EOS>
One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us, <EOS>
If we would have you. <EOS>
Second Lady: <EOS>
She is spread of late <EOS>
Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her! <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now <EOS>
I am for you again: pray you, sit by us, <EOS>
And tell 's a tale. <EOS>
MAMILLIUS: <EOS>
Merry or sad shall't be? <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
As merry as you will. <EOS>
MAMILLIUS: <EOS>
A sad tale's best for winter: I have one <EOS>
Of sprites and goblins. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Let's have that, good sir. <EOS>
Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best <EOS>
To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it. <EOS>
MAMILLIUS: <EOS>
There was a man-- <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Nay, come, sit down; then on. <EOS>
MAMILLIUS: <EOS>
Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly; <EOS>
Yond crickets shall not hear it. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Come on, then, <EOS>
And give't me in mine ear. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him? <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never <EOS>
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them <EOS>
Even to their ships. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
How blest am I <EOS>
In my just censure, in my true opinion! <EOS>
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed <EOS>
In being so blest! There may be in the cup <EOS>
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart, <EOS>
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge <EOS>
Is not infected: but if one present <EOS>
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known <EOS>
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides, <EOS>
With violent hefts. I have drunk, <EOS>
and seen the spider. <EOS>
Camillo was his help in this, his pander: <EOS>
There is a plot against my life, my crown; <EOS>
All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain <EOS>
Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him: <EOS>
He has discover'd my design, and I <EOS>
Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick <EOS>
For them to play at will. How came the posterns <EOS>
So easily open? <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
By his great authority; <EOS>
Which often hath no less prevail'd than so <EOS>
On your command. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
I know't too well. <EOS>
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him: <EOS>
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you <EOS>
Have too much blood in him. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
What is this? sport? <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her; <EOS>
Away with him! and let her sport herself <EOS>
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes <EOS>
Has made thee swell thus. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
But I'ld say he had not, <EOS>
And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying, <EOS>
Howe'er you lean to the nayward. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
You, my lords, <EOS>
Look on her, mark her well; be but about <EOS>
To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and <EOS>
The justice of your bearts will thereto add <EOS>
'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:' <EOS>
Praise her but for this her without-door form, <EOS>
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight <EOS>
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands <EOS>
That calumny doth use--O, I am out-- <EOS>
That mercy does, for calumny will sear <EOS>
Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's, <EOS>
When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between <EOS>
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known, <EOS>
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be, <EOS>
She's an adulteress. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Should a villain say so, <EOS>
The most replenish'd villain in the world, <EOS>
He were as much more villain: you, my lord, <EOS>
Do but mistake. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
You have mistook, my lady, <EOS>
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing! <EOS>
Which I'll not call a creature of thy place, <EOS>
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent, <EOS>
Should a like language use to all degrees <EOS>
And mannerly distinguishment leave out <EOS>
Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said <EOS>
She's an adulteress; I have said with whom: <EOS>
More, she's a traitor and Camillo is <EOS>
A federary with her, and one that knows <EOS>
What she should shame to know herself <EOS>
But with her most vile principal, that she's <EOS>
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those <EOS>
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy <EOS>
To this their late escape. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
No, by my life. <EOS>
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you, <EOS>
When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that <EOS>
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord, <EOS>
You scarce can right me throughly then to say <EOS>
You did mistake. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
No; if I mistake <EOS>
In those foundations which I build upon, <EOS>
The centre is not big enough to bear <EOS>
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison! <EOS>
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty <EOS>
But that he speaks. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
There's some ill planet reigns: <EOS>
I must be patient till the heavens look <EOS>
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords, <EOS>
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex <EOS>
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew <EOS>
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have <EOS>
That honourable grief lodged here which burns <EOS>
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords, <EOS>
With thoughts so qualified as your charities <EOS>
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so <EOS>
The king's will be perform'd! <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Shall I be heard? <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness, <EOS>
My women may be with me; for you see <EOS>
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools; <EOS>
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress <EOS>
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears <EOS>
As I come out: this action I now go on <EOS>
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord: <EOS>
I never wish'd to see you sorry; now <EOS>
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Go, do our bidding; hence! <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
Beseech your highness, call the queen again. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice <EOS>
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer, <EOS>
Yourself, your queen, your son. <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
For her, my lord, <EOS>
I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir, <EOS>
Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless <EOS>
I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean, <EOS>
In this which you accuse her. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
If it prove <EOS>
She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where <EOS>
I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her; <EOS>
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her; <EOS>
For every inch of woman in the world, <EOS>
Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Hold your peaces. <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
Good my lord,-- <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
It is for you we speak, not for ourselves: <EOS>
You are abused and by some putter-on <EOS>
That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain, <EOS>
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd, <EOS>
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven <EOS>
The second and the third, nine, and some five; <EOS>
If this prove true, they'll pay for't: <EOS>
by mine honour, <EOS>
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see, <EOS>
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs; <EOS>
And I had rather glib myself than they <EOS>
Should not produce fair issue. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Cease; no more. <EOS>
You smell this business with a sense as cold <EOS>
As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't <EOS>
As you feel doing thus; and see withal <EOS>
The instruments that feel. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
If it be so, <EOS>
We need no grave to bury honesty: <EOS>
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten <EOS>
Of the whole dungy earth. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
What! lack I credit? <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord, <EOS>
Upon this ground; and more it would content me <EOS>
To have her honour true than your suspicion, <EOS>
Be blamed for't how you might. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Why, what need we <EOS>
Commune with you of this, but rather follow <EOS>
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative <EOS>
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness <EOS>
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied <EOS>
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not <EOS>
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves <EOS>
We need no more of your advice: the matter, <EOS>
The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all <EOS>
Properly ours. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
And I wish, my liege, <EOS>
You had only in your silent judgment tried it, <EOS>
Without more overture. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
How could that be? <EOS>
Either thou art most ignorant by age, <EOS>
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight, <EOS>
Added to their familiarity, <EOS>
Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture, <EOS>
That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation <EOS>
But only seeing, all other circumstances <EOS>
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding: <EOS>
Yet, for a greater confirmation, <EOS>
For in an act of this importance 'twere <EOS>
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post <EOS>
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple, <EOS>
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know <EOS>
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle <EOS>
They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had, <EOS>
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well? <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
Well done, my lord. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Though I am satisfied and need no more <EOS>
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle <EOS>
Give rest to the minds of others, such as he <EOS>
Whose ignorant credulity will not <EOS>
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good <EOS>
From our free person she should be confined, <EOS>
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence <EOS>
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us; <EOS>
We are to speak in public; for this business <EOS>
Will raise us all. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
The keeper of the prison, call to him; <EOS>
let him have knowledge who I am. <EOS>
Good lady, <EOS>
No court in Europe is too good for thee; <EOS>
What dost thou then in prison? <EOS>
Now, good sir, <EOS>
You know me, do you not? <EOS>
Gaoler: <EOS>
For a worthy lady <EOS>
And one whom much I honour. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Pray you then, <EOS>
Conduct me to the queen. <EOS>
Gaoler: <EOS>
I may not, madam: <EOS>
To the contrary I have express commandment. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Here's ado, <EOS>
To lock up honesty and honour from <EOS>
The access of gentle visitors! <EOS>
Is't lawful, pray you, <EOS>
To see her women? any of them? Emilia? <EOS>
Gaoler: <EOS>
So please you, madam, <EOS>
To put apart these your attendants, I <EOS>
Shall bring Emilia forth. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
I pray now, call her. <EOS>
Withdraw yourselves. <EOS>
Gaoler: <EOS>
And, madam, <EOS>
I must be present at your conference. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Well, be't so, prithee. <EOS>
Here's such ado to make no stain a stain <EOS>
As passes colouring. <EOS>
Dear gentlewoman, <EOS>
How fares our gracious lady? <EOS>
EMILIA: <EOS>
As well as one so great and so forlorn <EOS>
May hold together: on her frights and griefs, <EOS>
Which never tender lady hath born greater, <EOS>
She is something before her time deliver'd. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
A boy? <EOS>
EMILIA: <EOS>
A daughter, and a goodly babe, <EOS>
Lusty and like to live: the queen receives <EOS>
Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner, <EOS>
I am innocent as you.' <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
I dare be sworn <EOS>
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king, <EOS>
beshrew them! <EOS>
He must be told on't, and he shall: the office <EOS>
Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me: <EOS>
If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister <EOS>
And never to my red-look'd anger be <EOS>
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia, <EOS>
Commend my best obedience to the queen: <EOS>
If she dares trust me with her little babe, <EOS>
I'll show't the king and undertake to be <EOS>
Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know <EOS>
How he may soften at the sight o' the child: <EOS>
The silence often of pure innocence <EOS>
Persuades when speaking fails. <EOS>
EMILIA: <EOS>
Most worthy madam, <EOS>
Your honour and your goodness is so evident <EOS>
That your free undertaking cannot miss <EOS>
A thriving issue: there is no lady living <EOS>
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship <EOS>
To visit the next room, I'll presently <EOS>
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer; <EOS>
Who but to-day hammer'd of this design, <EOS>
But durst not tempt a minister of honour, <EOS>
Lest she should be denied. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Tell her, Emilia. <EOS>
I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't <EOS>
As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted <EOS>
I shall do good. <EOS>
EMILIA: <EOS>
Now be you blest for it! <EOS>
I'll to the queen: please you, <EOS>
come something nearer. <EOS>
Gaoler: <EOS>
Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe, <EOS>
I know not what I shall incur to pass it, <EOS>
Having no warrant. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
You need not fear it, sir: <EOS>
This child was prisoner to the womb and is <EOS>
By law and process of great nature thence <EOS>
Freed and enfranchised, not a party to <EOS>
The anger of the king nor guilty of, <EOS>
If any be, the trespass of the queen. <EOS>
Gaoler: <EOS>
I do believe it. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Do not you fear: upon mine honour, <EOS>
I will stand betwixt you and danger. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness <EOS>
To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If <EOS>
The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause, <EOS>
She the adulteress; for the harlot king <EOS>
Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank <EOS>
And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she <EOS>
I can hook to me: say that she were gone, <EOS>
Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest <EOS>
Might come to me again. Who's there? <EOS>
First Servant: <EOS>
My lord? <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
How does the boy? <EOS>
First Servant: <EOS>
He took good rest to-night; <EOS>
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
To see his nobleness! <EOS>
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother, <EOS>
He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply, <EOS>
Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself, <EOS>
Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep, <EOS>
And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go, <EOS>
See how he fares. <EOS>
Fie, fie! no thought of him: <EOS>
The thought of my revenges that way <EOS>
Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty, <EOS>
And in his parties, his alliance; let him be <EOS>
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance, <EOS>
Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes <EOS>
Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow: <EOS>
They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor <EOS>
Shall she within my power. <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
You must not enter. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me: <EOS>
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas, <EOS>
Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul, <EOS>
More free than he is jealous. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
That's enough. <EOS>
Second Servant: <EOS>
Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded <EOS>
None should come at him. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Not so hot, good sir: <EOS>
I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you, <EOS>
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh <EOS>
At each his needless heavings, such as you <EOS>
Nourish the cause of his awaking: I <EOS>
Do come with words as medicinal as true, <EOS>
Honest as either, to purge him of that humour <EOS>
That presses him from sleep. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
What noise there, ho? <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
No noise, my lord; but needful conference <EOS>
About some gossips for your highness. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
How! <EOS>
Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus, <EOS>
I charged thee that she should not come about me: <EOS>
I knew she would. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
I told her so, my lord, <EOS>
On your displeasure's peril and on mine, <EOS>
She should not visit you. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
What, canst not rule her? <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
From all dishonesty he can: in this, <EOS>
Unless he take the course that you have done, <EOS>
Commit me for committing honour, trust it, <EOS>
He shall not rule me. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
La you now, you hear: <EOS>
When she will take the rein I let her run; <EOS>
But she'll not stumble. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Good my liege, I come; <EOS>
And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess <EOS>
Myself your loyal servant, your physician, <EOS>
Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare <EOS>
Less appear so in comforting your evils, <EOS>
Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come <EOS>
From your good queen. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Good queen! <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Good queen, my lord, <EOS>
Good queen; I say good queen; <EOS>
And would by combat make her good, so were I <EOS>
A man, the worst about you. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Force her hence. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes <EOS>
First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off; <EOS>
But first I'll do my errand. The good queen, <EOS>
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter; <EOS>
Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Out! <EOS>
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door: <EOS>
A most intelligencing bawd! <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Not so: <EOS>
I am as ignorant in that as you <EOS>
In so entitling me, and no less honest <EOS>
Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant, <EOS>
As this world goes, to pass for honest. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Traitors! <EOS>
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard. <EOS>
Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted <EOS>
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard; <EOS>
Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
For ever <EOS>
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou <EOS>
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness <EOS>
Which he has put upon't! <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
He dreads his wife. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt <EOS>
You'ld call your children yours. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
A nest of traitors! <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
I am none, by this good light. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Nor I, nor any <EOS>
But one that's here, and that's himself, for he <EOS>
The sacred honour of himself, his queen's, <EOS>
His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander, <EOS>
Whose sting is sharper than the sword's; <EOS>
and will not-- <EOS>
For, as the case now stands, it is a curse <EOS>
He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove <EOS>
The root of his opinion, which is rotten <EOS>
As ever oak or stone was sound. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
A callat <EOS>
Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband <EOS>
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine; <EOS>
It is the issue of Polixenes: <EOS>
Hence with it, and together with the dam <EOS>
Commit them to the fire! <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
It is yours; <EOS>
And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge, <EOS>
So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords, <EOS>
Although the print be little, the whole matter <EOS>
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip, <EOS>
The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley, <EOS>
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek, <EOS>
His smiles, <EOS>
The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger: <EOS>
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it <EOS>
So like to him that got it, if thou hast <EOS>
The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours <EOS>
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does, <EOS>
Her children not her husband's! <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
A gross hag <EOS>
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd, <EOS>
That wilt not stay her tongue. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
Hang all the husbands <EOS>
That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself <EOS>
Hardly one subject. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Once more, take her hence. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
A most unworthy and unnatural lord <EOS>
Can do no more. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
I'll ha' thee burnt. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
I care not: <EOS>
It is an heretic that makes the fire, <EOS>
Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant; <EOS>
But this most cruel usage of your queen, <EOS>
Not able to produce more accusation <EOS>
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours <EOS>
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you, <EOS>
Yea, scandalous to the world. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
On your allegiance, <EOS>
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant, <EOS>
Where were her life? she durst not call me so, <EOS>
If she did know me one. Away with her! <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone. <EOS>
Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours: <EOS>
Jove send her <EOS>
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands? <EOS>
You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies, <EOS>
Will never do him good, not one of you. <EOS>
So, so: farewell; we are gone. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this. <EOS>
My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast <EOS>
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence <EOS>
And see it instantly consumed with fire; <EOS>
Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight: <EOS>
Within this hour bring me word 'tis done, <EOS>
And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life, <EOS>
With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse <EOS>
And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so; <EOS>
The bastard brains with these my proper hands <EOS>
Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire; <EOS>
For thou set'st on thy wife. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
I did not, sir: <EOS>
These lords, my noble fellows, if they please, <EOS>
Can clear me in't. <EOS>
Lords: <EOS>
We can: my royal liege, <EOS>
He is not guilty of her coming hither. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
You're liars all. <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
Beseech your highness, give us better credit: <EOS>
We have always truly served you, and beseech you <EOS>
So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg, <EOS>
As recompense of our dear services <EOS>
Past and to come, that you do change this purpose, <EOS>
Which being so horrible, so bloody, must <EOS>
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
I am a feather for each wind that blows: <EOS>
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel <EOS>
And call me father? better burn it now <EOS>
Than curse it then. But be it; let it live. <EOS>
It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither; <EOS>
You that have been so tenderly officious <EOS>
With Lady Margery, your midwife there, <EOS>
To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard, <EOS>
So sure as this beard's grey, <EOS>
--what will you adventure <EOS>
To save this brat's life? <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
Any thing, my lord, <EOS>
That my ability may undergo <EOS>
And nobleness impose: at least thus much: <EOS>
I'll pawn the little blood which I have left <EOS>
To save the innocent: any thing possible. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
It shall be possible. Swear by this sword <EOS>
Thou wilt perform my bidding. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
I will, my lord. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail <EOS>
Of any point in't shall not only be <EOS>
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife, <EOS>
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee, <EOS>
As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry <EOS>
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it <EOS>
To some remote and desert place quite out <EOS>
Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it, <EOS>
Without more mercy, to its own protection <EOS>
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune <EOS>
It came to us, I do in justice charge thee, <EOS>
On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture, <EOS>
That thou commend it strangely to some place <EOS>
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
I swear to do this, though a present death <EOS>
Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe: <EOS>
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens <EOS>
To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say <EOS>
Casting their savageness aside have done <EOS>
Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous <EOS>
In more than this deed does require! And blessing <EOS>
Against this cruelty fight on thy side, <EOS>
Poor thing, condemn'd to loss! <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
No, I'll not rear <EOS>
Another's issue. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
Please your highness, posts <EOS>
From those you sent to the oracle are come <EOS>
An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion, <EOS>
Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed, <EOS>
Hasting to the court. <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
So please you, sir, their speed <EOS>
Hath been beyond account. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Twenty-three days <EOS>
They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells <EOS>
The great Apollo suddenly will have <EOS>
The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords; <EOS>
Summon a session, that we may arraign <EOS>
Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath <EOS>
Been publicly accused, so shall she have <EOS>
A just and open trial. While she lives <EOS>
My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me, <EOS>
And think upon my bidding. <EOS>
CLEOMENES: <EOS>
The climate's delicate, the air most sweet, <EOS>
Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing <EOS>
The common praise it bears. <EOS>
DION: <EOS>
I shall report, <EOS>
For most it caught me, the celestial habits, <EOS>
Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence <EOS>
Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice! <EOS>
How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly <EOS>
It was i' the offering! <EOS>
CLEOMENES: <EOS>
But of all, the burst <EOS>
And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle, <EOS>
Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense. <EOS>
That I was nothing. <EOS>
DION: <EOS>
If the event o' the journey <EOS>
Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!-- <EOS>
As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy, <EOS>
The time is worth the use on't. <EOS>
CLEOMENES: <EOS>
Great Apollo <EOS>
Turn all to the best! These proclamations, <EOS>
So forcing faults upon Hermione, <EOS>
I little like. <EOS>
DION: <EOS>
The violent carriage of it <EOS>
Will clear or end the business: when the oracle, <EOS>
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up, <EOS>
Shall the contents discover, something rare <EOS>
Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses! <EOS>
And gracious be the issue! <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce, <EOS>
Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried <EOS>
The daughter of a king, our wife, and one <EOS>
Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd <EOS>
Of being tyrannous, since we so openly <EOS>
Proceed in justice, which shall have due course, <EOS>
Even to the guilt or the purgation. <EOS>
Produce the prisoner. <EOS>
Officer: <EOS>
It is his highness' pleasure that the queen <EOS>
Appear in person here in court. Silence! <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Read the indictment. <EOS>
Officer: <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Since what I am to say must be but that <EOS>
Which contradicts my accusation and <EOS>
The testimony on my part no other <EOS>
But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me <EOS>
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity <EOS>
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it, <EOS>
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine <EOS>
Behold our human actions, as they do, <EOS>
I doubt not then but innocence shall make <EOS>
False accusation blush and tyranny <EOS>
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know, <EOS>
Who least will seem to do so, my past life <EOS>
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true, <EOS>
As I am now unhappy; which is more <EOS>
Than history can pattern, though devised <EOS>
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me <EOS>
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe <EOS>
A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter, <EOS>
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing <EOS>
To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore <EOS>
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it <EOS>
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour, <EOS>
'Tis a derivative from me to mine, <EOS>
And only that I stand for. I appeal <EOS>
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes <EOS>
Came to your court, how I was in your grace, <EOS>
How merited to be so; since he came, <EOS>
With what encounter so uncurrent I <EOS>
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond <EOS>
The bound of honour, or in act or will <EOS>
That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts <EOS>
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin <EOS>
Cry fie upon my grave! <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
I ne'er heard yet <EOS>
That any of these bolder vices wanted <EOS>
Less impudence to gainsay what they did <EOS>
Than to perform it first. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
That's true enough; <EOS>
Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
You will not own it. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
More than mistress of <EOS>
Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not <EOS>
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes, <EOS>
With whom I am accused, I do confess <EOS>
I loved him as in honour he required, <EOS>
With such a kind of love as might become <EOS>
A lady like me, with a love even such, <EOS>
So and no other, as yourself commanded: <EOS>
Which not to have done I think had been in me <EOS>
Both disobedience and ingratitude <EOS>
To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke, <EOS>
Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely <EOS>
That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy, <EOS>
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd <EOS>
For me to try how: all I know of it <EOS>
Is that Camillo was an honest man; <EOS>
And why he left your court, the gods themselves, <EOS>
Wotting no more than I, are ignorant. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
You knew of his departure, as you know <EOS>
What you have underta'en to do in's absence. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Sir, <EOS>
You speak a language that I understand not: <EOS>
My life stands in the level of your dreams, <EOS>
Which I'll lay down. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Your actions are my dreams; <EOS>
You had a bastard by Polixenes, <EOS>
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,-- <EOS>
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth: <EOS>
Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as <EOS>
Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself, <EOS>
No father owning it,--which is, indeed, <EOS>
More criminal in thee than it,--so thou <EOS>
Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage <EOS>
Look for no less than death. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Sir, spare your threats: <EOS>
The bug which you would fright me with I seek. <EOS>
To me can life be no commodity: <EOS>
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour, <EOS>
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone, <EOS>
But know not how it went. My second joy <EOS>
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence <EOS>
I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort <EOS>
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast, <EOS>
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth, <EOS>
Haled out to murder: myself on every post <EOS>
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred <EOS>
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs <EOS>
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried <EOS>
Here to this place, i' the open air, before <EOS>
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege, <EOS>
Tell me what blessings I have here alive, <EOS>
That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed. <EOS>
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life, <EOS>
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour, <EOS>
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd <EOS>
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else <EOS>
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you <EOS>
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all, <EOS>
I do refer me to the oracle: <EOS>
Apollo be my judge! <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
This your request <EOS>
Is altogether just: therefore bring forth, <EOS>
And in Apollos name, his oracle. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
The Emperor of Russia was my father: <EOS>
O that he were alive, and here beholding <EOS>
His daughter's trial! that he did but see <EOS>
The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes <EOS>
Of pity, not revenge! <EOS>
Officer: <EOS>
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice, <EOS>
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have <EOS>
Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought <EOS>
The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd <EOS>
Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then, <EOS>
You have not dared to break the holy seal <EOS>
Nor read the secrets in't. <EOS>
CLEOMENES: <EOS>
All this we swear. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Break up the seals and read. <EOS>
Officer: <EOS>
Lords: <EOS>
Now blessed be the great Apollo! <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
Praised! <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Hast thou read truth? <EOS>
Officer: <EOS>
Ay, my lord; even so <EOS>
As it is here set down. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
There is no truth at all i' the oracle: <EOS>
The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
My lord the king, the king! <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
What is the business? <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
O sir, I shall be hated to report it! <EOS>
The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear <EOS>
Of the queen's speed, is gone. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
How! gone! <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
Is dead. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves <EOS>
Do strike at my injustice. <EOS>
How now there! <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
This news is mortal to the queen: look down <EOS>
And see what death is doing. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Take her hence: <EOS>
Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover: <EOS>
I have too much believed mine own suspicion: <EOS>
Beseech you, tenderly apply to her <EOS>
Some remedies for life. <EOS>
Apollo, pardon <EOS>
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle! <EOS>
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes, <EOS>
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo, <EOS>
Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy; <EOS>
For, being transported by my jealousies <EOS>
To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose <EOS>
Camillo for the minister to poison <EOS>
My friend Polixenes: which had been done, <EOS>
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied <EOS>
My swift command, though I with death and with <EOS>
Reward did threaten and encourage him, <EOS>
Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane <EOS>
And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest <EOS>
Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here, <EOS>
Which you knew great, and to the hazard <EOS>
Of all encertainties himself commended, <EOS>
No richer than his honour: how he glisters <EOS>
Thorough my rust! and how his pity <EOS>
Does my deeds make the blacker! <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Woe the while! <EOS>
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it, <EOS>
Break too. <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
What fit is this, good lady? <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me? <EOS>
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling? <EOS>
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture <EOS>
Must I receive, whose every word deserves <EOS>
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny <EOS>
Together working with thy jealousies, <EOS>
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle <EOS>
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done <EOS>
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all <EOS>
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it. <EOS>
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing; <EOS>
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant <EOS>
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much, <EOS>
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour, <EOS>
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses, <EOS>
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon <EOS>
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter <EOS>
To be or none or little; though a devil <EOS>
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't: <EOS>
Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death <EOS>
Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts, <EOS>
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart <EOS>
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire <EOS>
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no, <EOS>
Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords, <EOS>
When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen, <EOS>
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead, <EOS>
and vengeance for't <EOS>
Not dropp'd down yet. <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
The higher powers forbid! <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath <EOS>
Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring <EOS>
Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye, <EOS>
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you <EOS>
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant! <EOS>
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier <EOS>
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee <EOS>
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees <EOS>
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting, <EOS>
Upon a barren mountain and still winter <EOS>
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods <EOS>
To look that way thou wert. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Go on, go on <EOS>
Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved <EOS>
All tongues to talk their bitterest. <EOS>
First Lord: <EOS>
Say no more: <EOS>
Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault <EOS>
I' the boldness of your speech. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
I am sorry for't: <EOS>
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them, <EOS>
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much <EOS>
The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd <EOS>
To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help <EOS>
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction <EOS>
At my petition; I beseech you, rather <EOS>
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you <EOS>
Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege <EOS>
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman: <EOS>
The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!-- <EOS>
I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children; <EOS>
I'll not remember you of my own lord, <EOS>
Who is lost too: take your patience to you, <EOS>
And I'll say nothing. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Thou didst speak but well <EOS>
When most the truth; which I receive much better <EOS>
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me <EOS>
To the dead bodies of my queen and son: <EOS>
One grave shall be for both: upon them shall <EOS>
The causes of their death appear, unto <EOS>
Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit <EOS>
The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there <EOS>
Shall be my recreation: so long as nature <EOS>
Will bear up with this exercise, so long <EOS>
I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me <EOS>
Unto these sorrows. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon <EOS>
The deserts of Bohemia? <EOS>
Mariner: <EOS>
Ay, my lord: and fear <EOS>
We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly <EOS>
And threaten present blusters. In my conscience, <EOS>
The heavens with that we have in hand are angry <EOS>
And frown upon 's. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard; <EOS>
Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before <EOS>
I call upon thee. <EOS>
Mariner: <EOS>
Make your best haste, and go not <EOS>
Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather; <EOS>
Besides, this place is famous for the creatures <EOS>
Of prey that keep upon't. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
Go thou away: <EOS>
I'll follow instantly. <EOS>
Mariner: <EOS>
I am glad at heart <EOS>
To be so rid o' the business. <EOS>
ANTIGONUS: <EOS>
Come, poor babe: <EOS>
I have heard, but not believed, <EOS>
the spirits o' the dead <EOS>
May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother <EOS>
Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream <EOS>
So like a waking. To me comes a creature, <EOS>
Sometimes her head on one side, some another; <EOS>
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow, <EOS>
So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes, <EOS>
Like very sanctity, she did approach <EOS>
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me, <EOS>
And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes <EOS>
Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon <EOS>
Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus, <EOS>
Since fate, against thy better disposition, <EOS>
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out <EOS>
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath, <EOS>
Places remote enough are in Bohemia, <EOS>
There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe <EOS>
Is counted lost for ever, Perdita, <EOS>
I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business <EOS>
Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see <EOS>
Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks <EOS>
She melted into air. Affrighted much, <EOS>
I did in time collect myself and thought <EOS>
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys: <EOS>
Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously, <EOS>
I will be squared by this. I do believe <EOS>
Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that <EOS>
Apollo would, this being indeed the issue <EOS>
Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid, <EOS>
Either for life or death, upon the earth <EOS>
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well! <EOS>
There lie, and there thy character: there these; <EOS>
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty, <EOS>
And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch, <EOS>
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed <EOS>
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot, <EOS>
But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I <EOS>
To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell! <EOS>
The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have <EOS>
A lullaby too rough: I never saw <EOS>
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour! <EOS>
Well may I get aboard! This is the chase: <EOS>
I am gone for ever. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
I would there were no age between sixteen and <EOS>
three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the <EOS>
rest; for there is nothing in the between but <EOS>
getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, <EOS>
stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but <EOS>
these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty <EOS>
hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my <EOS>
best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find <EOS>
than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by <EOS>
the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy <EOS>
will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very <EOS>
pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A <EOS>
pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape: <EOS>
though I am not bookish, yet I can read <EOS>
waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been <EOS>
some stair-work, some trunk-work, some <EOS>
behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this <EOS>
than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for <EOS>
pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed <EOS>
but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa! <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Hilloa, loa! <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk <EOS>
on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What <EOS>
ailest thou, man? <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land! <EOS>
but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the <EOS>
sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust <EOS>
a bodkin's point. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Why, boy, how is it? <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages, <EOS>
how it takes up the shore! but that's not the <EOS>
point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls! <EOS>
sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the <EOS>
ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon <EOS>
swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a <EOS>
cork into a hogshead. And then for the <EOS>
land-service, to see how the bear tore out his <EOS>
shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said <EOS>
his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an <EOS>
end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned <EOS>
it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the <EOS>
sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared <EOS>
and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than <EOS>
the sea or weather. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Name of mercy, when was this, boy? <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these <EOS>
sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor <EOS>
the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it <EOS>
now. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Would I had been by, to have helped the old man! <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
I would you had been by the ship side, to have <EOS>
helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here, <EOS>
boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things <EOS>
dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for <EOS>
thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's <EOS>
child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy; <EOS>
open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be <EOS>
rich by the fairies. This is some changeling: <EOS>
open't. What's within, boy? <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth <EOS>
are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold! <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up <EOS>
with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way. <EOS>
We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires <EOS>
nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good <EOS>
boy, the next way home. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see <EOS>
if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much <EOS>
he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they <EOS>
are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury <EOS>
it. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that <EOS>
which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the <EOS>
sight of him. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't. <EOS>
Time: <EOS>
I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror <EOS>
Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error, <EOS>
Now take upon me, in the name of Time, <EOS>
To use my wings. Impute it not a crime <EOS>
To me or my swift passage, that I slide <EOS>
O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried <EOS>
Of that wide gap, since it is in my power <EOS>
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour <EOS>
To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass <EOS>
The same I am, ere ancient'st order was <EOS>
Or what is now received: I witness to <EOS>
The times that brought them in; so shall I do <EOS>
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale <EOS>
The glistering of this present, as my tale <EOS>
Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing, <EOS>
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing <EOS>
As you had slept between: Leontes leaving, <EOS>
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving <EOS>
That he shuts up himself, imagine me, <EOS>
Gentle spectators, that I now may be <EOS>
In fair Bohemia, and remember well, <EOS>
I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel <EOS>
I now name to you; and with speed so pace <EOS>
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace <EOS>
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues <EOS>
I list not prophecy; but let Time's news <EOS>
Be known when 'tis brought forth. <EOS>
A shepherd's daughter, <EOS>
And what to her adheres, which follows after, <EOS>
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow, <EOS>
If ever you have spent time worse ere now; <EOS>
If never, yet that Time himself doth say <EOS>
He wishes earnestly you never may. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate: <EOS>
'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to <EOS>
grant this. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though <EOS>
I have for the most part been aired abroad, I <EOS>
desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent <EOS>
king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling <EOS>
sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to <EOS>
think so, which is another spur to my departure. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of <EOS>
thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of <EOS>
thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to <EOS>
have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having <EOS>
made me businesses which none without thee can <EOS>
sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute <EOS>
them thyself or take away with thee the very <EOS>
services thou hast done; which if I have not enough <EOS>
considered, as too much I cannot, to be more <EOS>
thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit <EOS>
therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal <EOS>
country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very <EOS>
naming punishes me with the remembrance of that <EOS>
penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king, <EOS>
my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen <EOS>
and children are even now to be afresh lamented. <EOS>
Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my <EOS>
son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not <EOS>
being gracious, than they are in losing them when <EOS>
they have approved their virtues. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What <EOS>
his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I <EOS>
have missingly noted, he is of late much retired <EOS>
from court and is less frequent to his princely <EOS>
exercises than formerly he hath appeared. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some <EOS>
care; so far that I have eyes under my service which <EOS>
look upon his removedness; from whom I have this <EOS>
intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a <EOS>
most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from <EOS>
very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his <EOS>
neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a <EOS>
daughter of most rare note: the report of her is <EOS>
extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I <EOS>
fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou <EOS>
shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not <EOS>
appearing what we are, have some question with the <EOS>
shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not <EOS>
uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither. <EOS>
Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and <EOS>
lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
I willingly obey your command. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
When daffodils begin to peer, <EOS>
With heigh! the doxy over the dale, <EOS>
Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year; <EOS>
For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale. <EOS>
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge, <EOS>
With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing! <EOS>
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge; <EOS>
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king. <EOS>
The lark, that tirra-lyra chants, <EOS>
With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay, <EOS>
Are summer songs for me and my aunts, <EOS>
While we lie tumbling in the hay. <EOS>
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time <EOS>
wore three-pile; but now I am out of service: <EOS>
But shall I go mourn for that, my dear? <EOS>
The pale moon shines by night: <EOS>
And when I wander here and there, <EOS>
I then do most go right. <EOS>
If tinkers may have leave to live, <EOS>
And bear the sow-skin budget, <EOS>
Then my account I well may, give, <EOS>
And in the stocks avouch it. <EOS>
My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to <EOS>
lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who <EOS>
being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise <EOS>
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and <EOS>
drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is <EOS>
the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful <EOS>
on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to <EOS>
me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought <EOS>
of it. A prize! a prize! <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod <EOS>
yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred <EOS>
shorn. what comes the wool to? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am <EOS>
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound <EOS>
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will <EOS>
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father <EOS>
hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it <EOS>
on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for <EOS>
the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good <EOS>
ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but <EOS>
one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to <EOS>
horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden <EOS>
pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note; <EOS>
nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I <EOS>
may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of <EOS>
raisins o' the sun. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
O that ever I was born! <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
I' the name of me-- <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and <EOS>
then, death, death! <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay <EOS>
on thee, rather than have these off. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more <EOS>
than the stripes I have received, which are mighty <EOS>
ones and millions. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a <EOS>
great matter. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel <EOS>
ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon <EOS>
me. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
What, by a horseman, or a footman? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
A footman, sweet sir, a footman. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he <EOS>
has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat, <EOS>
it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand, <EOS>
I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
O, good sir, tenderly, O! <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Alas, poor soul! <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my <EOS>
shoulder-blade is out. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
How now! canst stand? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have <EOS>
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence, <EOS>
unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or <EOS>
any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you; <EOS>
that kills my heart. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with <EOS>
troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the <EOS>
prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his <EOS>
virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped <EOS>
out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay <EOS>
there; and yet it will no more but abide. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he <EOS>
hath been since an ape-bearer; then a <EOS>
process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a <EOS>
motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's <EOS>
wife within a mile where my land and living lies; <EOS>
and, having flown over many knavish professions, he <EOS>
settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts <EOS>
wakes, fairs and bear-baitings. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that <EOS>
put me into this apparel. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had <EOS>
but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am <EOS>
false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant <EOS>
him. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
How do you now? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and <EOS>
walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace <EOS>
softly towards my kinsman's. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Shall I bring thee on the way? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our <EOS>
sheep-shearing. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Prosper you, sweet sir! <EOS>
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice. <EOS>
I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I <EOS>
make not this cheat bring out another and the <EOS>
shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name <EOS>
put in the book of virtue! <EOS>
Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way, <EOS>
And merrily hent the stile-a: <EOS>
A merry heart goes all the day, <EOS>
Your sad tires in a mile-a. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
These your unusual weeds to each part of you <EOS>
Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora <EOS>
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing <EOS>
Is as a meeting of the petty gods, <EOS>
And you the queen on't. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
Sir, my gracious lord, <EOS>
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me: <EOS>
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self, <EOS>
The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured <EOS>
With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid, <EOS>
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts <EOS>
In every mess have folly and the feeders <EOS>
Digest it with a custom, I should blush <EOS>
To see you so attired, sworn, I think, <EOS>
To show myself a glass. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
I bless the time <EOS>
When my good falcon made her flight across <EOS>
Thy father's ground. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
Now Jove afford you cause! <EOS>
To me the difference forges dread; your greatness <EOS>
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble <EOS>
To think your father, by some accident, <EOS>
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates! <EOS>
How would he look, to see his work so noble <EOS>
Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how <EOS>
Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold <EOS>
The sternness of his presence? <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Apprehend <EOS>
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves, <EOS>
Humbling their deities to love, have taken <EOS>
The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter <EOS>
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune <EOS>
A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god, <EOS>
Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain, <EOS>
As I seem now. Their transformations <EOS>
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer, <EOS>
Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires <EOS>
Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts <EOS>
Burn hotter than my faith. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
O, but, sir, <EOS>
Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis <EOS>
Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king: <EOS>
One of these two must be necessities, <EOS>
Which then will speak, that you must <EOS>
change this purpose, <EOS>
Or I my life. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Thou dearest Perdita, <EOS>
With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not <EOS>
The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair, <EOS>
Or not my father's. For I cannot be <EOS>
Mine own, nor any thing to any, if <EOS>
I be not thine. To this I am most constant, <EOS>
Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle; <EOS>
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing <EOS>
That you behold the while. Your guests are coming: <EOS>
Lift up your countenance, as it were the day <EOS>
Of celebration of that nuptial which <EOS>
We two have sworn shall come. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
O lady Fortune, <EOS>
Stand you auspicious! <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
See, your guests approach: <EOS>
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly, <EOS>
And let's be red with mirth. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon <EOS>
This day she was both pantler, butler, cook, <EOS>
Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all; <EOS>
Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here, <EOS>
At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle; <EOS>
On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire <EOS>
With labour and the thing she took to quench it, <EOS>
She would to each one sip. You are retired, <EOS>
As if you were a feasted one and not <EOS>
The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid <EOS>
These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is <EOS>
A way to make us better friends, more known. <EOS>
Come, quench your blushes and present yourself <EOS>
That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on, <EOS>
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing, <EOS>
As your good flock shall prosper. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Shepherdess, <EOS>
A fair one are you--well you fit our ages <EOS>
With flowers of winter. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
Sir, the year growing ancient, <EOS>
Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth <EOS>
Of trembling winter, the fairest <EOS>
flowers o' the season <EOS>
Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors, <EOS>
Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind <EOS>
Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not <EOS>
To get slips of them. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Wherefore, gentle maiden, <EOS>
Do you neglect them? <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
For I have heard it said <EOS>
There is an art which in their piedness shares <EOS>
With great creating nature. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Say there be; <EOS>
Yet nature is made better by no mean <EOS>
But nature makes that mean: so, over that art <EOS>
Which you say adds to nature, is an art <EOS>
That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry <EOS>
A gentler scion to the wildest stock, <EOS>
And make conceive a bark of baser kind <EOS>
By bud of nobler race: this is an art <EOS>
Which does mend nature, change it rather, but <EOS>
The art itself is nature. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
So it is. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors, <EOS>
And do not call them bastards. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
I'll not put <EOS>
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them; <EOS>
No more than were I painted I would wish <EOS>
This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore <EOS>
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you; <EOS>
Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram; <EOS>
The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun <EOS>
And with him rises weeping: these are flowers <EOS>
Of middle summer, and I think they are given <EOS>
To men of middle age. You're very welcome. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
I should leave grazing, were I of your flock, <EOS>
And only live by gazing. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
Out, alas! <EOS>
You'd be so lean, that blasts of January <EOS>
Would blow you through and through. <EOS>
Now, my fair'st friend, <EOS>
I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might <EOS>
Become your time of day; and yours, and yours, <EOS>
That wear upon your virgin branches yet <EOS>
Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina, <EOS>
For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall <EOS>
From Dis's waggon! daffodils, <EOS>
That come before the swallow dares, and take <EOS>
The winds of March with beauty; violets dim, <EOS>
But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes <EOS>
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses <EOS>
That die unmarried, ere they can behold <EOS>
Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady <EOS>
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and <EOS>
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds, <EOS>
The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack, <EOS>
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend, <EOS>
To strew him o'er and o'er! <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
What, like a corse? <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
No, like a bank for love to lie and play on; <EOS>
Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried, <EOS>
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers: <EOS>
Methinks I play as I have seen them do <EOS>
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine <EOS>
Does change my disposition. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
What you do <EOS>
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet. <EOS>
I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing, <EOS>
I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms, <EOS>
Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs, <EOS>
To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you <EOS>
A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do <EOS>
Nothing but that; move still, still so, <EOS>
And own no other function: each your doing, <EOS>
So singular in each particular, <EOS>
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed, <EOS>
That all your acts are queens. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
O Doricles, <EOS>
Your praises are too large: but that your youth, <EOS>
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't, <EOS>
Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd, <EOS>
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles, <EOS>
You woo'd me the false way. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
I think you have <EOS>
As little skill to fear as I have purpose <EOS>
To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray: <EOS>
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair, <EOS>
That never mean to part. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
I'll swear for 'em. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever <EOS>
Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems <EOS>
But smacks of something greater than herself, <EOS>
Too noble for this place. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
He tells her something <EOS>
That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is <EOS>
The queen of curds and cream. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Come on, strike up! <EOS>
DORCAS: <EOS>
Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic, <EOS>
To mend her kissing with! <EOS>
MOPSA: <EOS>
Now, in good time! <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners. <EOS>
Come, strike up! <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this <EOS>
Which dances with your daughter? <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
They call him Doricles; and boasts himself <EOS>
To have a worthy feeding: but I have it <EOS>
Upon his own report and I believe it; <EOS>
He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter: <EOS>
I think so too; for never gazed the moon <EOS>
Upon the water as he'll stand and read <EOS>
As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain. <EOS>
I think there is not half a kiss to choose <EOS>
Who loves another best. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
She dances featly. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
So she does any thing; though I report it, <EOS>
That should be silent: if young Doricles <EOS>
Do light upon her, she shall bring him that <EOS>
Which he not dreams of. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the <EOS>
door, you would never dance again after a tabour and <EOS>
pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings <EOS>
several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he <EOS>
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's <EOS>
ears grew to his tunes. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
He could never come better; he shall come in. I <EOS>
love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful <EOS>
matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing <EOS>
indeed and sung lamentably. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no <EOS>
milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he <EOS>
has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without <EOS>
bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate <EOS>
burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump <EOS>
her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would, <EOS>
as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into <EOS>
the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me <EOS>
no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with <EOS>
'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.' <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
This is a brave fellow. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited <EOS>
fellow. Has he any unbraided wares? <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow; <EOS>
points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can <EOS>
learnedly handle, though they come to him by the <EOS>
gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he <EOS>
sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you <EOS>
would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants <EOS>
to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
You have of these pedlars, that have more in them <EOS>
than you'ld think, sister. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
Ay, good brother, or go about to think. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Lawn as white as driven snow; <EOS>
Cyprus black as e'er was crow; <EOS>
Gloves as sweet as damask roses; <EOS>
Masks for faces and for noses; <EOS>
Bugle bracelet, necklace amber, <EOS>
Perfume for a lady's chamber; <EOS>
Golden quoifs and stomachers, <EOS>
For my lads to give their dears: <EOS>
Pins and poking-sticks of steel, <EOS>
What maids lack from head to heel: <EOS>
Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy; <EOS>
Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take <EOS>
no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it <EOS>
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves. <EOS>
MOPSA: <EOS>
I was promised them against the feast; but they come <EOS>
not too late now. <EOS>
DORCAS: <EOS>
He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars. <EOS>
MOPSA: <EOS>
He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has <EOS>
paid you more, which will shame you to give him again. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Is there no manners left among maids? will they <EOS>
wear their plackets where they should bear their <EOS>
faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are <EOS>
going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these <EOS>
secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all <EOS>
our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour <EOS>
your tongues, and not a word more. <EOS>
MOPSA: <EOS>
I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace <EOS>
and a pair of sweet gloves. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way <EOS>
and lost all my money? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad; <EOS>
therefore it behoves men to be wary. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
What hast here? ballads? <EOS>
MOPSA: <EOS>
Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o' <EOS>
life, for then we are sure they are true. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's <EOS>
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a <EOS>
burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and <EOS>
toads carbonadoed. <EOS>
MOPSA: <EOS>
Is it true, think you? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Very true, and but a month old. <EOS>
DORCAS: <EOS>
Bless me from marrying a usurer! <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress <EOS>
Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were <EOS>
present. Why should I carry lies abroad? <EOS>
MOPSA: <EOS>
Pray you now, buy it. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe <EOS>
ballads; we'll buy the other things anon. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon <EOS>
the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April, <EOS>
forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this <EOS>
ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was <EOS>
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold <EOS>
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that <EOS>
loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true. <EOS>
DORCAS: <EOS>
Is it true too, think you? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than <EOS>
my pack will hold. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Lay it by too: another. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one. <EOS>
MOPSA: <EOS>
Let's have some merry ones. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to <EOS>
the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's <EOS>
scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in <EOS>
request, I can tell you. <EOS>
MOPSA: <EOS>
We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou <EOS>
shalt hear; 'tis in three parts. <EOS>
DORCAS: <EOS>
We had the tune on't a month ago. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my <EOS>
occupation; have at it with you. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Get you hence, for I must go <EOS>
Where it fits not you to know. <EOS>
DORCAS: <EOS>
Whither? <EOS>
MOPSA: <EOS>
O, whither? <EOS>
DORCAS: <EOS>
Whither? <EOS>
MOPSA: <EOS>
It becomes thy oath full well, <EOS>
Thou to me thy secrets tell. <EOS>
DORCAS: <EOS>
Me too, let me go thither. <EOS>
MOPSA: <EOS>
Or thou goest to the orange or mill. <EOS>
DORCAS: <EOS>
If to either, thou dost ill. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Neither. <EOS>
DORCAS: <EOS>
What, neither? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Neither. <EOS>
DORCAS: <EOS>
Thou hast sworn my love to be. <EOS>
MOPSA: <EOS>
Thou hast sworn it more to me: <EOS>
Then whither goest? say, whither? <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my <EOS>
father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll <EOS>
not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after <EOS>
me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's <EOS>
have the first choice. Follow me, girls. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
And you shall pay well for 'em. <EOS>
Will you buy any tape, <EOS>
Or lace for your cape, <EOS>
My dainty duck, my dear-a? <EOS>
Any silk, any thread, <EOS>
Any toys for your head, <EOS>
Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a? <EOS>
Come to the pedlar; <EOS>
Money's a medler. <EOS>
That doth utter all men's ware-a. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
Master, there is three carters, three shepherds, <EOS>
three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made <EOS>
themselves all men of hair, they call themselves <EOS>
Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches <EOS>
say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are <EOS>
not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it <EOS>
be not too rough for some that know little but <EOS>
bowling, it will please plentifully. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much <EOS>
homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see <EOS>
these four threes of herdsmen. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath <EOS>
danced before the king; and not the worst of the <EOS>
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Leave your prating: since these good men are <EOS>
pleased, let them come in; but quickly now. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
Why, they stay at door, sir. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter. <EOS>
Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them. <EOS>
He's simple and tells much. <EOS>
How now, fair shepherd! <EOS>
Your heart is full of something that does take <EOS>
Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young <EOS>
And handed love as you do, I was wont <EOS>
To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd <EOS>
The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it <EOS>
To her acceptance; you have let him go <EOS>
And nothing marted with him. If your lass <EOS>
Interpretation should abuse and call this <EOS>
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited <EOS>
For a reply, at least if you make a care <EOS>
Of happy holding her. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Old sir, I know <EOS>
She prizes not such trifles as these are: <EOS>
The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd <EOS>
Up in my heart; which I have given already, <EOS>
But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life <EOS>
Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem, <EOS>
Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand, <EOS>
As soft as dove's down and as white as it, <EOS>
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd <EOS>
snow that's bolted <EOS>
By the northern blasts twice o'er. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
What follows this? <EOS>
How prettily the young swain seems to wash <EOS>
The hand was fair before! I have put you out: <EOS>
But to your protestation; let me hear <EOS>
What you profess. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Do, and be witness to 't. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
And this my neighbour too? <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
And he, and more <EOS>
Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all: <EOS>
That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch, <EOS>
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth <EOS>
That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge <EOS>
More than was ever man's, I would not prize them <EOS>
Without her love; for her employ them all; <EOS>
Commend them and condemn them to her service <EOS>
Or to their own perdition. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Fairly offer'd. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
This shows a sound affection. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
But, my daughter, <EOS>
Say you the like to him? <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
I cannot speak <EOS>
So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better: <EOS>
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out <EOS>
The purity of his. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Take hands, a bargain! <EOS>
And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't: <EOS>
I give my daughter to him, and will make <EOS>
Her portion equal his. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
O, that must be <EOS>
I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead, <EOS>
I shall have more than you can dream of yet; <EOS>
Enough then for your wonder. But, come on, <EOS>
Contract us 'fore these witnesses. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Come, your hand; <EOS>
And, daughter, yours. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you; <EOS>
Have you a father? <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
I have: but what of him? <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Knows he of this? <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
He neither does nor shall. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Methinks a father <EOS>
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest <EOS>
That best becomes the table. Pray you once more, <EOS>
Is not your father grown incapable <EOS>
Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid <EOS>
With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear? <EOS>
Know man from man? dispute his own estate? <EOS>
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing <EOS>
But what he did being childish? <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
No, good sir; <EOS>
He has his health and ampler strength indeed <EOS>
Than most have of his age. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
By my white beard, <EOS>
You offer him, if this be so, a wrong <EOS>
Something unfilial: reason my son <EOS>
Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason <EOS>
The father, all whose joy is nothing else <EOS>
But fair posterity, should hold some counsel <EOS>
In such a business. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
I yield all this; <EOS>
But for some other reasons, my grave sir, <EOS>
Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint <EOS>
My father of this business. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Let him know't. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
He shall not. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Prithee, let him. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
No, he must not. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve <EOS>
At knowing of thy choice. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Come, come, he must not. <EOS>
Mark our contract. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Mark your divorce, young sir, <EOS>
Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base <EOS>
To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir, <EOS>
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor, <EOS>
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can <EOS>
But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece <EOS>
Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know <EOS>
The royal fool thou copest with,-- <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
O, my heart! <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made <EOS>
More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy, <EOS>
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh <EOS>
That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never <EOS>
I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession; <EOS>
Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin, <EOS>
Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words: <EOS>
Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time, <EOS>
Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee <EOS>
From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.-- <EOS>
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too, <EOS>
That makes himself, but for our honour therein, <EOS>
Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou <EOS>
These rural latches to his entrance open, <EOS>
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces, <EOS>
I will devise a death as cruel for thee <EOS>
As thou art tender to't. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
Even here undone! <EOS>
I was not much afeard; for once or twice <EOS>
I was about to speak and tell him plainly, <EOS>
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court <EOS>
Hides not his visage from our cottage but <EOS>
Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone? <EOS>
I told you what would come of this: beseech you, <EOS>
Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,-- <EOS>
Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther, <EOS>
But milk my ewes and weep. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Why, how now, father! <EOS>
Speak ere thou diest. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
I cannot speak, nor think <EOS>
Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir! <EOS>
You have undone a man of fourscore three, <EOS>
That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea, <EOS>
To die upon the bed my father died, <EOS>
To lie close by his honest bones: but now <EOS>
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me <EOS>
Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch, <EOS>
That knew'st this was the prince, <EOS>
and wouldst adventure <EOS>
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone! <EOS>
If I might die within this hour, I have lived <EOS>
To die when I desire. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Why look you so upon me? <EOS>
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd, <EOS>
But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am; <EOS>
More straining on for plucking back, not following <EOS>
My leash unwillingly. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Gracious my lord, <EOS>
You know your father's temper: at this time <EOS>
He will allow no speech, which I do guess <EOS>
You do not purpose to him; and as hardly <EOS>
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear: <EOS>
Then, till the fury of his highness settle, <EOS>
Come not before him. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
I not purpose it. <EOS>
I think, Camillo? <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Even he, my lord. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
How often have I told you 'twould be thus! <EOS>
How often said, my dignity would last <EOS>
But till 'twere known! <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
It cannot fail but by <EOS>
The violation of my faith; and then <EOS>
Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together <EOS>
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks: <EOS>
From my succession wipe me, father; I <EOS>
Am heir to my affection. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Be advised. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
I am, and by my fancy: if my reason <EOS>
Will thereto be obedient, I have reason; <EOS>
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness, <EOS>
Do bid it welcome. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
This is desperate, sir. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
So call it: but it does fulfil my vow; <EOS>
I needs must think it honesty. Camillo, <EOS>
Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may <EOS>
Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or <EOS>
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides <EOS>
In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath <EOS>
To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you, <EOS>
As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend, <EOS>
When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not <EOS>
To see him any more,--cast your good counsels <EOS>
Upon his passion; let myself and fortune <EOS>
Tug for the time to come. This you may know <EOS>
And so deliver, I am put to sea <EOS>
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore; <EOS>
And most opportune to our need I have <EOS>
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared <EOS>
For this design. What course I mean to hold <EOS>
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor <EOS>
Concern me the reporting. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
O my lord! <EOS>
I would your spirit were easier for advice, <EOS>
Or stronger for your need. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Hark, Perdita <EOS>
I'll hear you by and by. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
He's irremoveable, <EOS>
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if <EOS>
His going I could frame to serve my turn, <EOS>
Save him from danger, do him love and honour, <EOS>
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia <EOS>
And that unhappy king, my master, whom <EOS>
I so much thirst to see. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Now, good Camillo; <EOS>
I am so fraught with curious business that <EOS>
I leave out ceremony. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Sir, I think <EOS>
You have heard of my poor services, i' the love <EOS>
That I have borne your father? <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Very nobly <EOS>
Have you deserved: it is my father's music <EOS>
To speak your deeds, not little of his care <EOS>
To have them recompensed as thought on. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Well, my lord, <EOS>
If you may please to think I love the king <EOS>
And through him what is nearest to him, which is <EOS>
Your gracious self, embrace but my direction: <EOS>
If your more ponderous and settled project <EOS>
May suffer alteration, on mine honour, <EOS>
I'll point you where you shall have such receiving <EOS>
As shall become your highness; where you may <EOS>
Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see, <EOS>
There's no disjunction to be made, but by-- <EOS>
As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her, <EOS>
And, with my best endeavours in your absence, <EOS>
Your discontenting father strive to qualify <EOS>
And bring him up to liking. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
How, Camillo, <EOS>
May this, almost a miracle, be done? <EOS>
That I may call thee something more than man <EOS>
And after that trust to thee. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Have you thought on <EOS>
A place whereto you'll go? <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Not any yet: <EOS>
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty <EOS>
To what we wildly do, so we profess <EOS>
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies <EOS>
Of every wind that blows. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Then list to me: <EOS>
This follows, if you will not change your purpose <EOS>
But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia, <EOS>
And there present yourself and your fair princess, <EOS>
For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes: <EOS>
She shall be habited as it becomes <EOS>
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see <EOS>
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping <EOS>
His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness, <EOS>
As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands <EOS>
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him <EOS>
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one <EOS>
He chides to hell and bids the other grow <EOS>
Faster than thought or time. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Worthy Camillo, <EOS>
What colour for my visitation shall I <EOS>
Hold up before him? <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Sent by the king your father <EOS>
To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir, <EOS>
The manner of your bearing towards him, with <EOS>
What you as from your father shall deliver, <EOS>
Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down: <EOS>
The which shall point you forth at every sitting <EOS>
What you must say; that he shall not perceive <EOS>
But that you have your father's bosom there <EOS>
And speak his very heart. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
I am bound to you: <EOS>
There is some sap in this. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
A cause more promising <EOS>
Than a wild dedication of yourselves <EOS>
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain <EOS>
To miseries enough; no hope to help you, <EOS>
But as you shake off one to take another; <EOS>
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who <EOS>
Do their best office, if they can but stay you <EOS>
Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know <EOS>
Prosperity's the very bond of love, <EOS>
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together <EOS>
Affliction alters. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
One of these is true: <EOS>
I think affliction may subdue the cheek, <EOS>
But not take in the mind. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Yea, say you so? <EOS>
There shall not at your father's house these <EOS>
seven years <EOS>
Be born another such. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
My good Camillo, <EOS>
She is as forward of her breeding as <EOS>
She is i' the rear our birth. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
I cannot say 'tis pity <EOS>
She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress <EOS>
To most that teach. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
Your pardon, sir; for this <EOS>
I'll blush you thanks. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
My prettiest Perdita! <EOS>
But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo, <EOS>
Preserver of my father, now of me, <EOS>
The medicine of our house, how shall we do? <EOS>
We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son, <EOS>
Nor shall appear in Sicilia. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
My lord, <EOS>
Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes <EOS>
Do all lie there: it shall be so my care <EOS>
To have you royally appointed as if <EOS>
The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir, <EOS>
That you may know you shall not want, one word. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his <EOS>
sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold <EOS>
all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a <EOS>
ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, <EOS>
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, <EOS>
to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who <EOS>
should buy first, as if my trinkets had been <EOS>
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer: <EOS>
by which means I saw whose purse was best in <EOS>
picture; and what I saw, to my good use I <EOS>
remembered. My clown, who wants but something to <EOS>
be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the <EOS>
wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes <EOS>
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the <EOS>
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses <EOS>
stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it <EOS>
was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a <EOS>
purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in <EOS>
chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song, <EOS>
and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this <EOS>
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their <EOS>
festival purses; and had not the old man come in <EOS>
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's <EOS>
son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not <EOS>
left a purse alive in the whole army. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Nay, but my letters, by this means being there <EOS>
So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
And those that you'll procure from King Leontes-- <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Shall satisfy your father. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
Happy be you! <EOS>
All that you speak shows fair. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Who have we here? <EOS>
We'll make an instrument of this, omit <EOS>
Nothing may give us aid. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
If they have overheard me now, why, hanging. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear <EOS>
not, man; here's no harm intended to thee. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
I am a poor fellow, sir. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from <EOS>
thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must <EOS>
make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly, <EOS>
--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and <EOS>
change garments with this gentleman: though the <EOS>
pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee, <EOS>
there's some boot. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
I am a poor fellow, sir. <EOS>
I know ye well enough. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half <EOS>
flayed already. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Are you in earnest, sir? <EOS>
I smell the trick on't. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Dispatch, I prithee. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with <EOS>
conscience take it. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Unbuckle, unbuckle. <EOS>
Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy <EOS>
Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself <EOS>
Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat <EOS>
And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face, <EOS>
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken <EOS>
The truth of your own seeming; that you may-- <EOS>
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard <EOS>
Get undescried. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
I see the play so lies <EOS>
That I must bear a part. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
No remedy. <EOS>
Have you done there? <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Should I now meet my father, <EOS>
He would not call me son. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
Nay, you shall have no hat. <EOS>
Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Adieu, sir. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
O Perdita, what have we twain forgot! <EOS>
Pray you, a word. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Fortune speed us! <EOS>
Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
The swifter speed the better. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
I understand the business, I hear it: to have an <EOS>
open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is <EOS>
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite <EOS>
also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see <EOS>
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. <EOS>
What an exchange had this been without boot! What <EOS>
a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do <EOS>
this year connive at us, and we may do any thing <EOS>
extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of <EOS>
iniquity, stealing away from his father with his <EOS>
clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of <EOS>
honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not <EOS>
do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it; <EOS>
and therein am I constant to my profession. <EOS>
Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain: <EOS>
every lane's end, every shop, church, session, <EOS>
hanging, yields a careful man work. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
See, see; what a man you are now! <EOS>
There is no other way but to tell the king <EOS>
she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Nay, but hear me. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Nay, but hear me. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Go to, then. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh <EOS>
and blood has not offended the king; and so your <EOS>
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show <EOS>
those things you found about her, those secret <EOS>
things, all but what she has with her: this being <EOS>
done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his <EOS>
son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man, <EOS>
neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make <EOS>
me the king's brother-in-law. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you <EOS>
could have been to him and then your blood had been <EOS>
the dearer by I know how much an ounce. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Well, let us to the king: there is that in this <EOS>
fardel will make him scratch his beard. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Pray heartily he be at palace. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
To the palace, an it like your worship. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition <EOS>
of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your <EOS>
names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any <EOS>
thing that is fitting to be known, discover. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
We are but plain fellows, sir. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no <EOS>
lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they <EOS>
often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for <EOS>
it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore <EOS>
they do not give us the lie. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Your worship had like to have given us one, if you <EOS>
had not taken yourself with the manner. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest <EOS>
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings? <EOS>
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court? <EOS>
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I <EOS>
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou, <EOS>
for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy <EOS>
business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier <EOS>
cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck <EOS>
back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to <EOS>
open thy affair. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
My business, sir, is to the king. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
What advocate hast thou to him? <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
I know not, an't like you. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you <EOS>
have none. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
How blessed are we that are not simple men! <EOS>
Yet nature might have made me as these are, <EOS>
Therefore I will not disdain. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
This cannot be but a great courtier. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
His garments are rich, but he wears <EOS>
them not handsomely. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical: <EOS>
a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking <EOS>
on's teeth. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
The fardel there? what's i' the fardel? <EOS>
Wherefore that box? <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box, <EOS>
which none must know but the king; and which he <EOS>
shall know within this hour, if I may come to the <EOS>
speech of him. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Age, thou hast lost thy labour. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Why, sir? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a <EOS>
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for, <EOS>
if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must <EOS>
know the king is full of grief. <EOS>
Shepard: <EOS>
So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have <EOS>
married a shepherd's daughter. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly: <EOS>
the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall <EOS>
feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Think you so, sir? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy <EOS>
and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to <EOS>
him, though removed fifty times, shall all come <EOS>
under the hangman: which though it be great pity, <EOS>
yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a <EOS>
ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into <EOS>
grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death <EOS>
is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a <EOS>
sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't <EOS>
like you, sir? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then <EOS>
'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a <EOS>
wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters <EOS>
and a dram dead; then recovered again with <EOS>
aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as <EOS>
he is, and in the hottest day prognostication <EOS>
proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the <EOS>
sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he <EOS>
is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what <EOS>
talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries <EOS>
are to be smiled at, their offences being so <EOS>
capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain <EOS>
men, what you have to the king: being something <EOS>
gently considered, I'll bring you where he is <EOS>
aboard, tender your persons to his presence, <EOS>
whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man <EOS>
besides the king to effect your suits, here is man <EOS>
shall do it. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
He seems to be of great authority: close with him, <EOS>
give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn <EOS>
bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show <EOS>
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, <EOS>
and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.' <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for <EOS>
us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much <EOS>
more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
After I have done what I promised? <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Ay, sir. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business? <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful <EOS>
one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him, <EOS>
he'll be made an example. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show <EOS>
our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your <EOS>
daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I <EOS>
will give you as much as this old man does when the <EOS>
business is performed, and remain, as he says, your <EOS>
pawn till it be brought you. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side; <EOS>
go on the right hand: I will but look upon the <EOS>
hedge and follow you. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would <EOS>
not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am <EOS>
courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means <EOS>
to do the prince my master good; which who knows how <EOS>
that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring <EOS>
these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he <EOS>
think it fit to shore them again and that the <EOS>
complaint they have to the king concerns him <EOS>
nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far <EOS>
officious; for I am proof against that title and <EOS>
what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present <EOS>
them: there may be matter in it. <EOS>
CLEOMENES: <EOS>
Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd <EOS>
A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make, <EOS>
Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down <EOS>
More penitence than done trespass: at the last, <EOS>
Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil; <EOS>
With them forgive yourself. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Whilst I remember <EOS>
Her and her virtues, I cannot forget <EOS>
My blemishes in them, and so still think of <EOS>
The wrong I did myself; which was so much, <EOS>
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and <EOS>
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man <EOS>
Bred his hopes out of. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
True, too true, my lord: <EOS>
If, one by one, you wedded all the world, <EOS>
Or from the all that are took something good, <EOS>
To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd <EOS>
Would be unparallel'd. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
I think so. Kill'd! <EOS>
She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me <EOS>
Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter <EOS>
Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now, <EOS>
Say so but seldom. <EOS>
CLEOMENES: <EOS>
Not at all, good lady: <EOS>
You might have spoken a thousand things that would <EOS>
Have done the time more benefit and graced <EOS>
Your kindness better. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
You are one of those <EOS>
Would have him wed again. <EOS>
DION: <EOS>
If you would not so, <EOS>
You pity not the state, nor the remembrance <EOS>
Of his most sovereign name; consider little <EOS>
What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue, <EOS>
May drop upon his kingdom and devour <EOS>
Incertain lookers on. What were more holy <EOS>
Than to rejoice the former queen is well? <EOS>
What holier than, for royalty's repair, <EOS>
For present comfort and for future good, <EOS>
To bless the bed of majesty again <EOS>
With a sweet fellow to't? <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
There is none worthy, <EOS>
Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods <EOS>
Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes; <EOS>
For has not the divine Apollo said, <EOS>
Is't not the tenor of his oracle, <EOS>
That King Leontes shall not have an heir <EOS>
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall, <EOS>
Is all as monstrous to our human reason <EOS>
As my Antigonus to break his grave <EOS>
And come again to me; who, on my life, <EOS>
Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel <EOS>
My lord should to the heavens be contrary, <EOS>
Oppose against their wills. <EOS>
Care not for issue; <EOS>
The crown will find an heir: great Alexander <EOS>
Left his to the worthiest; so his successor <EOS>
Was like to be the best. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Good Paulina, <EOS>
Who hast the memory of Hermione, <EOS>
I know, in honour, O, that ever I <EOS>
Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now, <EOS>
I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes, <EOS>
Have taken treasure from her lips-- <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
And left them <EOS>
More rich for what they yielded. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Thou speak'st truth. <EOS>
No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse, <EOS>
And better used, would make her sainted spirit <EOS>
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage, <EOS>
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd, <EOS>
And begin, 'Why to me?' <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Had she such power, <EOS>
She had just cause. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
She had; and would incense me <EOS>
To murder her I married. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
I should so. <EOS>
Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark <EOS>
Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't <EOS>
You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears <EOS>
Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd <EOS>
Should be 'Remember mine.' <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Stars, stars, <EOS>
And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife; <EOS>
I'll have no wife, Paulina. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Will you swear <EOS>
Never to marry but by my free leave? <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit! <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath. <EOS>
CLEOMENES: <EOS>
You tempt him over-much. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Unless another, <EOS>
As like Hermione as is her picture, <EOS>
Affront his eye. <EOS>
CLEOMENES: <EOS>
Good madam,-- <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
I have done. <EOS>
Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir, <EOS>
No remedy, but you will,--give me the office <EOS>
To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young <EOS>
As was your former; but she shall be such <EOS>
As, walk'd your first queen's ghost, <EOS>
it should take joy <EOS>
To see her in your arms. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
My true Paulina, <EOS>
We shall not marry till thou bid'st us. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
That <EOS>
Shall be when your first queen's again in breath; <EOS>
Never till then. <EOS>
Gentleman: <EOS>
One that gives out himself Prince Florizel, <EOS>
Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she <EOS>
The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access <EOS>
To your high presence. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
What with him? he comes not <EOS>
Like to his father's greatness: his approach, <EOS>
So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us <EOS>
'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced <EOS>
By need and accident. What train? <EOS>
Gentleman: <EOS>
But few, <EOS>
And those but mean. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
His princess, say you, with him? <EOS>
Gentleman: <EOS>
Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think, <EOS>
That e'er the sun shone bright on. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
O Hermione, <EOS>
As every present time doth boast itself <EOS>
Above a better gone, so must thy grave <EOS>
Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself <EOS>
Have said and writ so, but your writing now <EOS>
Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been, <EOS>
Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse <EOS>
Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd, <EOS>
To say you have seen a better. <EOS>
Gentleman: <EOS>
Pardon, madam: <EOS>
The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,-- <EOS>
The other, when she has obtain'd your eye, <EOS>
Will have your tongue too. This is a creature, <EOS>
Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal <EOS>
Of all professors else, make proselytes <EOS>
Of who she but bid follow. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
How! not women? <EOS>
Gentleman: <EOS>
Women will love her, that she is a woman <EOS>
More worth than any man; men, that she is <EOS>
The rarest of all women. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Go, Cleomenes; <EOS>
Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends, <EOS>
Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange <EOS>
He thus should steal upon us. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Had our prince, <EOS>
Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd <EOS>
Well with this lord: there was not full a month <EOS>
Between their births. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st <EOS>
He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure, <EOS>
When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches <EOS>
Will bring me to consider that which may <EOS>
Unfurnish me of reason. They are come. <EOS>
Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince; <EOS>
For she did print your royal father off, <EOS>
Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one, <EOS>
Your father's image is so hit in you, <EOS>
His very air, that I should call you brother, <EOS>
As I did him, and speak of something wildly <EOS>
By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome! <EOS>
And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas! <EOS>
I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth <EOS>
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as <EOS>
You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost-- <EOS>
All mine own folly--the society, <EOS>
Amity too, of your brave father, whom, <EOS>
Though bearing misery, I desire my life <EOS>
Once more to look on him. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
By his command <EOS>
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him <EOS>
Give you all greetings that a king, at friend, <EOS>
Can send his brother: and, but infirmity <EOS>
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized <EOS>
His wish'd ability, he had himself <EOS>
The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his <EOS>
Measured to look upon you; whom he loves-- <EOS>
He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres <EOS>
And those that bear them living. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
O my brother, <EOS>
Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir <EOS>
Afresh within me, and these thy offices, <EOS>
So rarely kind, are as interpreters <EOS>
Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither, <EOS>
As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too <EOS>
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage, <EOS>
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune, <EOS>
To greet a man not worth her pains, much less <EOS>
The adventure of her person? <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Good my lord, <EOS>
She came from Libya. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Where the warlike Smalus, <EOS>
That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved? <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter <EOS>
His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence, <EOS>
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd, <EOS>
To execute the charge my father gave me <EOS>
For visiting your highness: my best train <EOS>
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd; <EOS>
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify <EOS>
Not only my success in Libya, sir, <EOS>
But my arrival and my wife's in safety <EOS>
Here where we are. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
The blessed gods <EOS>
Purge all infection from our air whilst you <EOS>
Do climate here! You have a holy father, <EOS>
A graceful gentleman; against whose person, <EOS>
So sacred as it is, I have done sin: <EOS>
For which the heavens, taking angry note, <EOS>
Have left me issueless; and your father's blest, <EOS>
As he from heaven merits it, with you <EOS>
Worthy his goodness. What might I have been, <EOS>
Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on, <EOS>
Such goodly things as you! <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Most noble sir, <EOS>
That which I shall report will bear no credit, <EOS>
Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir, <EOS>
Bohemia greets you from himself by me; <EOS>
Desires you to attach his son, who has-- <EOS>
His dignity and duty both cast off-- <EOS>
Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with <EOS>
A shepherd's daughter. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Where's Bohemia? speak. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Here in your city; I now came from him: <EOS>
I speak amazedly; and it becomes <EOS>
My marvel and my message. To your court <EOS>
Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems, <EOS>
Of this fair couple, meets he on the way <EOS>
The father of this seeming lady and <EOS>
Her brother, having both their country quitted <EOS>
With this young prince. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Camillo has betray'd me; <EOS>
Whose honour and whose honesty till now <EOS>
Endured all weathers. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Lay't so to his charge: <EOS>
He's with the king your father. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Who? Camillo? <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now <EOS>
Has these poor men in question. Never saw I <EOS>
Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth; <EOS>
Forswear themselves as often as they speak: <EOS>
Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them <EOS>
With divers deaths in death. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
O my poor father! <EOS>
The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have <EOS>
Our contract celebrated. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
You are married? <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
We are not, sir, nor are we like to be; <EOS>
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first: <EOS>
The odds for high and low's alike. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
My lord, <EOS>
Is this the daughter of a king? <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
She is, <EOS>
When once she is my wife. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
That 'once' I see by your good father's speed <EOS>
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry, <EOS>
Most sorry, you have broken from his liking <EOS>
Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry <EOS>
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty, <EOS>
That you might well enjoy her. <EOS>
FLORIZEL: <EOS>
Dear, look up: <EOS>
Though Fortune, visible an enemy, <EOS>
Should chase us with my father, power no jot <EOS>
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir, <EOS>
Remember since you owed no more to time <EOS>
Than I do now: with thought of such affections, <EOS>
Step forth mine advocate; at your request <EOS>
My father will grant precious things as trifles. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress, <EOS>
Which he counts but a trifle. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Sir, my liege, <EOS>
Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month <EOS>
'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes <EOS>
Than what you look on now. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
I thought of her, <EOS>
Even in these looks I made. <EOS>
But your petition <EOS>
Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father: <EOS>
Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires, <EOS>
I am friend to them and you: upon which errand <EOS>
I now go toward him; therefore follow me <EOS>
And mark what way I make: come, good my lord. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation? <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old <EOS>
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it: <EOS>
whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all <EOS>
commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I <EOS>
heard the shepherd say, he found the child. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
I would most gladly know the issue of it. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
I make a broken delivery of the business; but the <EOS>
changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were <EOS>
very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with <EOS>
staring on one another, to tear the cases of their <EOS>
eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language <EOS>
in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard <EOS>
of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable <EOS>
passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest <EOS>
beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not <EOS>
say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the <EOS>
extremity of the one, it must needs be. <EOS>
Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more. <EOS>
The news, Rogero? <EOS>
Second Gentleman: <EOS>
Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the <EOS>
king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is <EOS>
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers <EOS>
cannot be able to express it. <EOS>
Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can <EOS>
deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news <EOS>
which is called true is so like an old tale, that <EOS>
the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king <EOS>
found his heir? <EOS>
Third Gentleman: <EOS>
Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by <EOS>
circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you <EOS>
see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle <EOS>
of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it, <EOS>
the letters of Antigonus found with it which they <EOS>
know to be his character, the majesty of the <EOS>
creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection <EOS>
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding, <EOS>
and many other evidences proclaim her with all <EOS>
certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see <EOS>
the meeting of the two kings? <EOS>
Second Gentleman: <EOS>
No. <EOS>
Third Gentleman: <EOS>
Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen, <EOS>
cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one <EOS>
joy crown another, so and in such manner that it <EOS>
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their <EOS>
joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, <EOS>
holding up of hands, with countenances of such <EOS>
distraction that they were to be known by garment, <EOS>
not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of <EOS>
himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that <EOS>
joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother, <EOS>
thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then <EOS>
embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his <EOS>
daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old <EOS>
shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten <EOS>
conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such <EOS>
another encounter, which lames report to follow it <EOS>
and undoes description to do it. <EOS>
Second Gentleman: <EOS>
What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried <EOS>
hence the child? <EOS>
Third Gentleman: <EOS>
Like an old tale still, which will have matter to <EOS>
rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear <EOS>
open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this <EOS>
avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his <EOS>
innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a <EOS>
handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
What became of his bark and his followers? <EOS>
Third Gentleman: <EOS>
Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and <EOS>
in the view of the shepherd: so that all the <EOS>
instruments which aided to expose the child were <EOS>
even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble <EOS>
combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in <EOS>
Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of <EOS>
her husband, another elevated that the oracle was <EOS>
fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth, <EOS>
and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin <EOS>
her to her heart that she might no more be in danger <EOS>
of losing. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of <EOS>
kings and princes; for by such was it acted. <EOS>
Third Gentleman: <EOS>
One of the prettiest touches of all and that which <EOS>
angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not <EOS>
the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's <EOS>
death, with the manner how she came to't bravely <EOS>
confessed and lamented by the king, how <EOS>
attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one <EOS>
sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,' <EOS>
I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my <EOS>
heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed <EOS>
colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world <EOS>
could have seen 't, the woe had been universal. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
Are they returned to the court? <EOS>
Third Gentleman: <EOS>
No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue, <EOS>
which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many <EOS>
years in doing and now newly performed by that rare <EOS>
Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself <EOS>
eternity and could put breath into his work, would <EOS>
beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her <EOS>
ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that <EOS>
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of <EOS>
answer: thither with all greediness of affection <EOS>
are they gone, and there they intend to sup. <EOS>
Second Gentleman: <EOS>
I thought she had some great matter there in hand; <EOS>
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever <EOS>
since the death of Hermione, visited that removed <EOS>
house. Shall we thither and with our company piece <EOS>
the rejoicing? <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access? <EOS>
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born: <EOS>
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge. <EOS>
Let's along. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, <EOS>
would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old <EOS>
man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard <EOS>
them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he <EOS>
at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter, <EOS>
so he then took her to be, who began to be much <EOS>
sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of <EOS>
weather continuing, this mystery remained <EOS>
undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I <EOS>
been the finder out of this secret, it would not <EOS>
have relished among my other discredits. <EOS>
Here come those I have done good to against my will, <EOS>
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and <EOS>
daughters will be all gentlemen born. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me <EOS>
this other day, because I was no gentleman born. <EOS>
See you these clothes? say you see them not and <EOS>
think me still no gentleman born: you were best say <EOS>
these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the <EOS>
lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Ay, and have been so any time these four hours. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
And so have I, boy. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my <EOS>
father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and <EOS>
called me brother; and then the two kings called my <EOS>
father brother; and then the prince my brother and <EOS>
the princess my sister called my father father; and <EOS>
so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like <EOS>
tears that ever we shed. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
We may live, son, to shed many more. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so <EOS>
preposterous estate as we are. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the <EOS>
faults I have committed to your worship and to give <EOS>
me your good report to the prince my master. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are <EOS>
gentlemen. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Thou wilt amend thy life? <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
Ay, an it like your good worship. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou <EOS>
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
You may say it, but not swear it. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and <EOS>
franklins say it, I'll swear it. <EOS>
Shepherd: <EOS>
How if it be false, son? <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear <EOS>
it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to <EOS>
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and <EOS>
that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no <EOS>
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be <EOS>
drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst <EOS>
be a tall fellow of thy hands. <EOS>
AUTOLYCUS: <EOS>
I will prove so, sir, to my power. <EOS>
Clown: <EOS>
Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not <EOS>
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not <EOS>
being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings <EOS>
and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the <EOS>
queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy <EOS>
good masters. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort <EOS>
That I have had of thee! <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
What, sovereign sir, <EOS>
I did not well I meant well. All my services <EOS>
You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed, <EOS>
With your crown'd brother and these your contracted <EOS>
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit, <EOS>
It is a surplus of your grace, which never <EOS>
My life may last to answer. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
O Paulina, <EOS>
We honour you with trouble: but we came <EOS>
To see the statue of our queen: your gallery <EOS>
Have we pass'd through, not without much content <EOS>
In many singularities; but we saw not <EOS>
That which my daughter came to look upon, <EOS>
The statue of her mother. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
As she lived peerless, <EOS>
So her dead likeness, I do well believe, <EOS>
Excels whatever yet you look'd upon <EOS>
Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it <EOS>
Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare <EOS>
To see the life as lively mock'd as ever <EOS>
Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well. <EOS>
I like your silence, it the more shows off <EOS>
Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege, <EOS>
Comes it not something near? <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Her natural posture! <EOS>
Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed <EOS>
Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she <EOS>
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender <EOS>
As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina, <EOS>
Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing <EOS>
So aged as this seems. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
O, not by much. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
So much the more our carver's excellence; <EOS>
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her <EOS>
As she lived now. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
As now she might have done, <EOS>
So much to my good comfort, as it is <EOS>
Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood, <EOS>
Even with such life of majesty, warm life, <EOS>
As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her! <EOS>
I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me <EOS>
For being more stone than it? O royal piece, <EOS>
There's magic in thy majesty, which has <EOS>
My evils conjured to remembrance and <EOS>
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits, <EOS>
Standing like stone with thee. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
And give me leave, <EOS>
And do not say 'tis superstition, that <EOS>
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady, <EOS>
Dear queen, that ended when I but began, <EOS>
Give me that hand of yours to kiss. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
O, patience! <EOS>
The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on, <EOS>
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away, <EOS>
So many summers dry; scarce any joy <EOS>
Did ever so long live; no sorrow <EOS>
But kill'd itself much sooner. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Dear my brother, <EOS>
Let him that was the cause of this have power <EOS>
To take off so much grief from you as he <EOS>
Will piece up in himself. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Indeed, my lord, <EOS>
If I had thought the sight of my poor image <EOS>
Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine-- <EOS>
I'ld not have show'd it. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Do not draw the curtain. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy <EOS>
May think anon it moves. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Let be, let be. <EOS>
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already-- <EOS>
What was he that did make it? See, my lord, <EOS>
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins <EOS>
Did verily bear blood? <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Masterly done: <EOS>
The very life seems warm upon her lip. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
The fixture of her eye has motion in't, <EOS>
As we are mock'd with art. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
I'll draw the curtain: <EOS>
My lord's almost so far transported that <EOS>
He'll think anon it lives. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
O sweet Paulina, <EOS>
Make me to think so twenty years together! <EOS>
No settled senses of the world can match <EOS>
The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but <EOS>
I could afflict you farther. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Do, Paulina; <EOS>
For this affliction has a taste as sweet <EOS>
As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks, <EOS>
There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel <EOS>
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me, <EOS>
For I will kiss her. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Good my lord, forbear: <EOS>
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet; <EOS>
You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own <EOS>
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain? <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
No, not these twenty years. <EOS>
PERDITA: <EOS>
So long could I <EOS>
Stand by, a looker on. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Either forbear, <EOS>
Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you <EOS>
For more amazement. If you can behold it, <EOS>
I'll make the statue move indeed, descend <EOS>
And take you by the hand; but then you'll think-- <EOS>
Which I protest against--I am assisted <EOS>
By wicked powers. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
What you can make her do, <EOS>
I am content to look on: what to speak, <EOS>
I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy <EOS>
To make her speak as move. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
It is required <EOS>
You do awake your faith. Then all stand still; <EOS>
On: those that think it is unlawful business <EOS>
I am about, let them depart. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
Proceed: <EOS>
No foot shall stir. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
Music, awake her; strike! <EOS>
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach; <EOS>
Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come, <EOS>
I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away, <EOS>
Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him <EOS>
Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs: <EOS>
Start not; her actions shall be holy as <EOS>
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her <EOS>
Until you see her die again; for then <EOS>
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand: <EOS>
When she was young you woo'd her; now in age <EOS>
Is she become the suitor? <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
O, she's warm! <EOS>
If this be magic, let it be an art <EOS>
Lawful as eating. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
She embraces him. <EOS>
CAMILLO: <EOS>
She hangs about his neck: <EOS>
If she pertain to life let her speak too. <EOS>
POLIXENES: <EOS>
Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived, <EOS>
Or how stolen from the dead. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
That she is living, <EOS>
Were it but told you, should be hooted at <EOS>
Like an old tale: but it appears she lives, <EOS>
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while. <EOS>
Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel <EOS>
And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady; <EOS>
Our Perdita is found. <EOS>
HERMIONE: <EOS>
You gods, look down <EOS>
And from your sacred vials pour your graces <EOS>
Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own. <EOS>
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found <EOS>
Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I, <EOS>
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle <EOS>
Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved <EOS>
Myself to see the issue. <EOS>
PAULINA: <EOS>
There's time enough for that; <EOS>
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble <EOS>
Your joys with like relation. Go together, <EOS>
You precious winners all; your exultation <EOS>
Partake to every one. I, an old turtle, <EOS>
Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there <EOS>
My mate, that's never to be found again, <EOS>
Lament till I am lost. <EOS>
LEONTES: <EOS>
O, peace, Paulina! <EOS>
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent, <EOS>
As I by thine a wife: this is a match, <EOS>
And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine; <EOS>
But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her, <EOS>
As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many <EOS>
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far-- <EOS>
For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee <EOS>
An honourable husband. Come, Camillo, <EOS>
And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty <EOS>
Is richly noted and here justified <EOS>
By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place. <EOS>
What! look upon my brother: both your pardons, <EOS>
That e'er I put between your holy looks <EOS>
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law, <EOS>
And son unto the king, who, heavens directing, <EOS>
Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina, <EOS>
Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely <EOS>
Each one demand an answer to his part <EOS>
Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first <EOS>
We were dissever'd: hastily lead away. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Escalus. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
My lord. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Of government the properties to unfold, <EOS>
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse; <EOS>
Since I am put to know that your own science <EOS>
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice <EOS>
My strength can give you: then no more remains, <EOS>
But that to your sufficiency, as your Worth is able, <EOS>
And let them work. The nature of our people, <EOS>
Our city's institutions, and the terms <EOS>
For common justice, you're as pregnant in <EOS>
As art and practise hath enriched any <EOS>
That we remember. There is our commission, <EOS>
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither, <EOS>
I say, bid come before us Angelo. <EOS>
What figure of us think you he will bear? <EOS>
For you must know, we have with special soul <EOS>
Elected him our absence to supply, <EOS>
Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love, <EOS>
And given his deputation all the organs <EOS>
Of our own power: what think you of it? <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
If any in Vienna be of worth <EOS>
To undergo such ample grace and honour, <EOS>
It is Lord Angelo. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Look where he comes. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Always obedient to your grace's will, <EOS>
I come to know your pleasure. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Angelo, <EOS>
There is a kind of character in thy life, <EOS>
That to the observer doth thy history <EOS>
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings <EOS>
Are not thine own so proper as to waste <EOS>
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee. <EOS>
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do, <EOS>
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues <EOS>
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike <EOS>
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd <EOS>
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends <EOS>
The smallest scruple of her excellence <EOS>
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines <EOS>
Herself the glory of a creditor, <EOS>
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech <EOS>
To one that can my part in him advertise; <EOS>
Hold therefore, Angelo:-- <EOS>
In our remove be thou at full ourself; <EOS>
Mortality and mercy in Vienna <EOS>
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus, <EOS>
Though first in question, is thy secondary. <EOS>
Take thy commission. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Now, good my lord, <EOS>
Let there be some more test made of my metal, <EOS>
Before so noble and so great a figure <EOS>
Be stamp'd upon it. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
No more evasion: <EOS>
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice <EOS>
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours. <EOS>
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition <EOS>
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd <EOS>
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you, <EOS>
As time and our concernings shall importune, <EOS>
How it goes with us, and do look to know <EOS>
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well; <EOS>
To the hopeful execution do I leave you <EOS>
Of your commissions. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Yet give leave, my lord, <EOS>
That we may bring you something on the way. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
My haste may not admit it; <EOS>
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do <EOS>
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own <EOS>
So to enforce or qualify the laws <EOS>
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand: <EOS>
I'll privily away. I love the people, <EOS>
But do not like to stage me to their eyes: <EOS>
Through it do well, I do not relish well <EOS>
Their loud applause and Aves vehement; <EOS>
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion <EOS>
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
The heavens give safety to your purposes! <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness! <EOS>
DUKE: <EOS>
I thank you. Fare you well. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave <EOS>
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me <EOS>
To look into the bottom of my place: <EOS>
A power I have, but of what strength and nature <EOS>
I am not yet instructed. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together, <EOS>
And we may soon our satisfaction have <EOS>
Touching that point. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
I'll wait upon your honour. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
If the duke with the other dukes come not to <EOS>
composition with the King of Hungary, why then all <EOS>
the dukes fall upon the king. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of <EOS>
Hungary's! <EOS>
Second Gentleman: <EOS>
Amen. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that <EOS>
went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped <EOS>
one out of the table. <EOS>
Second Gentleman: <EOS>
'Thou shalt not steal'? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Ay, that he razed. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and <EOS>
all the rest from their functions: they put forth <EOS>
to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in <EOS>
the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition <EOS>
well that prays for peace. <EOS>
Second Gentleman: <EOS>
I never heard any soldier dislike it. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where <EOS>
grace was said. <EOS>
Second Gentleman: <EOS>
No? a dozen times at least. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
What, in metre? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
In any proportion or in any language. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
I think, or in any religion. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all <EOS>
controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a <EOS>
wicked villain, despite of all grace. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
I grant; as there may between the lists and the <EOS>
velvet. Thou art the list. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt <EOS>
a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief <EOS>
be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou <EOS>
art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak <EOS>
feelingly now? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful <EOS>
feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own <EOS>
confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I <EOS>
live, forget to drink after thee. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not? <EOS>
Second Gentleman: <EOS>
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I <EOS>
have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to-- <EOS>
Second Gentleman: <EOS>
To what, I pray? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Judge. <EOS>
Second Gentleman: <EOS>
To three thousand dolours a year. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
Ay, and more. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
A French crown more. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou <EOS>
art full of error; I am sound. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as <EOS>
things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow; <EOS>
impiety has made a feast of thee. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica? <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried <EOS>
to prison was worth five thousand of you all. <EOS>
Second Gentleman: <EOS>
Who's that, I pray thee? <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
Claudio to prison? 'tis not so. <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw <EOS>
him carried away; and, which is more, within these <EOS>
three days his head to be chopped off. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. <EOS>
Art thou sure of this? <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam <EOS>
Julietta with child. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two <EOS>
hours since, and he was ever precise in <EOS>
promise-keeping. <EOS>
Second Gentleman: <EOS>
Besides, you know, it draws something near to the <EOS>
speech we had to such a purpose. <EOS>
First Gentleman: <EOS>
But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Away! let's go learn the truth of it. <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what <EOS>
with the gallows and what with poverty, I am <EOS>
custom-shrunk. <EOS>
How now! what's the news with you? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Yonder man is carried to prison. <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
Well; what has he done? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
A woman. <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
But what's his offence? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river. <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
What, is there a maid with child by him? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have <EOS>
not heard of the proclamation, have you? <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
What proclamation, man? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down. <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
And what shall become of those in the city? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too, <EOS>
but that a wise burgher put in for them. <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be <EOS>
pulled down? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
To the ground, mistress. <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth! <EOS>
What shall become of me? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no <EOS>
clients: though you change your place, you need not <EOS>
change your trade; I'll be your tapster still. <EOS>
Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that <EOS>
have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you <EOS>
will be considered. <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to <EOS>
prison; and there's Madam Juliet. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world? <EOS>
Bear me to prison, where I am committed. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
I do it not in evil disposition, <EOS>
But from Lord Angelo by special charge. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Thus can the demigod Authority <EOS>
Make us pay down for our offence by weight <EOS>
The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will; <EOS>
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint? <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty: <EOS>
As surfeit is the father of much fast, <EOS>
So every scope by the immoderate use <EOS>
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue, <EOS>
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane, <EOS>
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would <EOS>
send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say <EOS>
the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom <EOS>
as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy <EOS>
offence, Claudio? <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
What but to speak of would offend again. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
What, is't murder? <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
No. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Lechery? <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Call it so. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Away, sir! you must go. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
A hundred, if they'll do you any good. <EOS>
Is lechery so look'd after? <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract <EOS>
I got possession of Julietta's bed: <EOS>
You know the lady; she is fast my wife, <EOS>
Save that we do the denunciation lack <EOS>
Of outward order: this we came not to, <EOS>
Only for propagation of a dower <EOS>
Remaining in the coffer of her friends, <EOS>
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love <EOS>
Till time had made them for us. But it chances <EOS>
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment <EOS>
With character too gross is writ on Juliet. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
With child, perhaps? <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Unhappily, even so. <EOS>
And the new deputy now for the duke-- <EOS>
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness, <EOS>
Or whether that the body public be <EOS>
A horse whereon the governor doth ride, <EOS>
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know <EOS>
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur; <EOS>
Whether the tyranny be in his place, <EOS>
Or in his emmence that fills it up, <EOS>
I stagger in:--but this new governor <EOS>
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties <EOS>
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall <EOS>
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round <EOS>
And none of them been worn; and, for a name, <EOS>
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act <EOS>
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on <EOS>
thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, <EOS>
may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to <EOS>
him. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
I have done so, but he's not to be found. <EOS>
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service: <EOS>
This day my sister should the cloister enter <EOS>
And there receive her approbation: <EOS>
Acquaint her with the danger of my state: <EOS>
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends <EOS>
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him: <EOS>
I have great hope in that; for in her youth <EOS>
There is a prone and speechless dialect, <EOS>
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art <EOS>
When she will play with reason and discourse, <EOS>
And well she can persuade. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the <EOS>
like, which else would stand under grievous <EOS>
imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I <EOS>
would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a <EOS>
game of tick-tack. I'll to her. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
I thank you, good friend Lucio. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Within two hours. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Come, officer, away! <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
No, holy father; throw away that thought; <EOS>
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love <EOS>
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee <EOS>
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose <EOS>
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends <EOS>
Of burning youth. <EOS>
FRIAR THOMAS: <EOS>
May your grace speak of it? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
My holy sir, none better knows than you <EOS>
How I have ever loved the life removed <EOS>
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies <EOS>
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps. <EOS>
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo, <EOS>
A man of stricture and firm abstinence, <EOS>
My absolute power and place here in Vienna, <EOS>
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland; <EOS>
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear, <EOS>
And so it is received. Now, pious sir, <EOS>
You will demand of me why I do this? <EOS>
FRIAR THOMAS: <EOS>
Gladly, my lord. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
We have strict statutes and most biting laws. <EOS>
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds, <EOS>
Which for this nineteen years we have let slip; <EOS>
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave, <EOS>
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers, <EOS>
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch, <EOS>
Only to stick it in their children's sight <EOS>
For terror, not to use, in time the rod <EOS>
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees, <EOS>
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead; <EOS>
And liberty plucks justice by the nose; <EOS>
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart <EOS>
Goes all decorum. <EOS>
FRIAR THOMAS: <EOS>
It rested in your grace <EOS>
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased: <EOS>
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd <EOS>
Than in Lord Angelo. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
I do fear, too dreadful: <EOS>
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope, <EOS>
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them <EOS>
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done, <EOS>
When evil deeds have their permissive pass <EOS>
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father, <EOS>
I have on Angelo imposed the office; <EOS>
Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home, <EOS>
And yet my nature never in the fight <EOS>
To do in slander. And to behold his sway, <EOS>
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order, <EOS>
Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee, <EOS>
Supply me with the habit and instruct me <EOS>
How I may formally in person bear me <EOS>
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action <EOS>
At our more leisure shall I render you; <EOS>
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise; <EOS>
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses <EOS>
That his blood flows, or that his appetite <EOS>
Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see, <EOS>
If power change purpose, what our seemers be. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
And have you nuns no farther privileges? <EOS>
FRANCISCA: <EOS>
Are not these large enough? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more; <EOS>
But rather wishing a more strict restraint <EOS>
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Who's that which calls? <EOS>
FRANCISCA: <EOS>
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella, <EOS>
Turn you the key, and know his business of him; <EOS>
You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn. <EOS>
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men <EOS>
But in the presence of the prioress: <EOS>
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face, <EOS>
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak. <EOS>
He calls again; I pray you, answer him. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses <EOS>
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me <EOS>
As bring me to the sight of Isabella, <EOS>
A novice of this place and the fair sister <EOS>
To her unhappy brother Claudio? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask, <EOS>
The rather for I now must make you know <EOS>
I am that Isabella and his sister. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you: <EOS>
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Woe me! for what? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
For that which, if myself might be his judge, <EOS>
He should receive his punishment in thanks: <EOS>
He hath got his friend with child. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Sir, make me not your story. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
It is true. <EOS>
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin <EOS>
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest, <EOS>
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so: <EOS>
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted. <EOS>
By your renouncement an immortal spirit, <EOS>
And to be talk'd with in sincerity, <EOS>
As with a saint. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus: <EOS>
Your brother and his lover have embraced: <EOS>
As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time <EOS>
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings <EOS>
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb <EOS>
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Is she your cousin? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names <EOS>
By vain though apt affection. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
She it is. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O, let him marry her. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
This is the point. <EOS>
The duke is very strangely gone from hence; <EOS>
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one, <EOS>
In hand and hope of action: but we do learn <EOS>
By those that know the very nerves of state, <EOS>
His givings-out were of an infinite distance <EOS>
From his true-meant design. Upon his place, <EOS>
And with full line of his authority, <EOS>
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood <EOS>
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels <EOS>
The wanton stings and motions of the sense, <EOS>
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge <EOS>
With profits of the mind, study and fast. <EOS>
He--to give fear to use and liberty, <EOS>
Which have for long run by the hideous law, <EOS>
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act, <EOS>
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life <EOS>
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it; <EOS>
And follows close the rigour of the statute, <EOS>
To make him an example. All hope is gone, <EOS>
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer <EOS>
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business <EOS>
'Twixt you and your poor brother. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Doth he so seek his life? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Has censured him <EOS>
Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath <EOS>
A warrant for his execution. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Alas! what poor ability's in me <EOS>
To do him good? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Assay the power you have. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
My power? Alas, I doubt-- <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Our doubts are traitors <EOS>
And make us lose the good we oft might win <EOS>
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo, <EOS>
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue, <EOS>
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel, <EOS>
All their petitions are as freely theirs <EOS>
As they themselves would owe them. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I'll see what I can do. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
But speedily. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I will about it straight; <EOS>
No longer staying but to give the mother <EOS>
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you: <EOS>
Commend me to my brother: soon at night <EOS>
I'll send him certain word of my success. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
I take my leave of you. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Good sir, adieu. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
We must not make a scarecrow of the law, <EOS>
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey, <EOS>
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it <EOS>
Their perch and not their terror. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Ay, but yet <EOS>
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little, <EOS>
Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman <EOS>
Whom I would save, had a most noble father! <EOS>
Let but your honour know, <EOS>
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue, <EOS>
That, in the working of your own affections, <EOS>
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing, <EOS>
Or that the resolute acting of your blood <EOS>
Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose, <EOS>
Whether you had not sometime in your life <EOS>
Err'd in this point which now you censure him, <EOS>
And pull'd the law upon you. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus, <EOS>
Another thing to fall. I not deny, <EOS>
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life, <EOS>
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two <EOS>
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice, <EOS>
That justice seizes: what know the laws <EOS>
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant, <EOS>
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't <EOS>
Because we see it; but what we do not see <EOS>
We tread upon, and never think of it. <EOS>
You may not so extenuate his offence <EOS>
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me, <EOS>
When I, that censure him, do so offend, <EOS>
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death, <EOS>
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Be it as your wisdom will. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Where is the provost? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Here, if it like your honour. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
See that Claudio <EOS>
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning: <EOS>
Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared; <EOS>
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Come, bring them away: if these be good people in <EOS>
a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in <EOS>
common houses, I know no law: bring them away. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's <EOS>
constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon <EOS>
justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good <EOS>
honour two notorious benefactors. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are <EOS>
they not malefactors? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
If it? please your honour, I know not well what they <EOS>
are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure <EOS>
of; and void of all profanation in the world that <EOS>
good Christians ought to have. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
This comes off well; here's a wise officer. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your <EOS>
name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
What are you, sir? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that <EOS>
serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they <EOS>
say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she <EOS>
professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
How know you that? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,-- <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
How? thy wife? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,-- <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Dost thou detest her therefore? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as <EOS>
she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house, <EOS>
it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
How dost thou know that, constable? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman <EOS>
cardinally given, might have been accused in <EOS>
fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
By the woman's means? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she <EOS>
spit in his face, so she defied him. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so. <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable <EOS>
man; prove it. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Do you hear how he misplaces? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, <EOS>
saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes; <EOS>
sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very <EOS>
distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a <EOS>
dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen <EOS>
such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very <EOS>
good dishes,-- <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in <EOS>
the right: but to the point. As I say, this <EOS>
Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and <EOS>
being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for <EOS>
prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said, <EOS>
Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the <EOS>
rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very <EOS>
honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could <EOS>
not give you three-pence again. <EOS>
FROTH: <EOS>
No, indeed. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Very well: you being then, if you be remembered, <EOS>
cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,-- <EOS>
FROTH: <EOS>
Ay, so I did indeed. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be <EOS>
remembered, that such a one and such a one were past <EOS>
cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very <EOS>
good diet, as I told you,-- <EOS>
FROTH: <EOS>
All this is true. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Why, very well, then,-- <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What <EOS>
was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to <EOS>
complain of? Come me to what was done to her. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
No, sir, nor I mean it not. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's <EOS>
leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth <EOS>
here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose <EOS>
father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas, <EOS>
Master Froth? <EOS>
FROTH: <EOS>
All-hallond eve. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir, <EOS>
sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in <EOS>
the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight <EOS>
to sit, have you not? <EOS>
FROTH: <EOS>
I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
This will last out a night in Russia, <EOS>
When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave. <EOS>
And leave you to the hearing of the cause; <EOS>
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship. <EOS>
Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once. <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
I beseech your honour, ask me. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face. <EOS>
Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a <EOS>
good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face? <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Ay, sir, very well. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Nay; I beseech you, mark it well. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Well, I do so. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Doth your honour see any harm in his face? <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Why, no. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst <EOS>
thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the <EOS>
worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the <EOS>
constable's wife any harm? I would know that of <EOS>
your honour. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
First, an it like you, the house is a respected <EOS>
house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his <EOS>
mistress is a respected woman. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected <EOS>
person than any of us all. <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the <EOS>
time has yet to come that she was ever respected <EOS>
with man, woman, or child. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is <EOS>
this true? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked <EOS>
Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married <EOS>
to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she <EOS>
with me, let not your worship think me the poor <EOS>
duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or <EOS>
I'll have mine action of battery on thee. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your <EOS>
action of slander too. <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't <EOS>
your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff? <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him <EOS>
that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him <EOS>
continue in his courses till thou knowest what they <EOS>
are. <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou <EOS>
wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art <EOS>
to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Where were you born, friend? <EOS>
FROTH: <EOS>
Here in Vienna, sir. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Are you of fourscore pounds a year? <EOS>
FROTH: <EOS>
Yes, an't please you, sir. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
So. What trade are you of, sir? <EOS>
POMPHEY: <EOS>
Tapster; a poor widow's tapster. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Your mistress' name? <EOS>
POMPHEY: <EOS>
Mistress Overdone. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Hath she had any more than one husband? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master <EOS>
Froth, I would not have you acquainted with <EOS>
tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you <EOS>
will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no <EOS>
more of you. <EOS>
FROTH: <EOS>
I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never <EOS>
come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn <EOS>
in. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell. <EOS>
Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your <EOS>
name, Master tapster? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Pompey. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
What else? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Bum, sir. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; <EOS>
so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the <EOS>
Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey, <EOS>
howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you <EOS>
not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What <EOS>
do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
If the law would allow it, sir. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall <EOS>
not be allowed in Vienna. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the <EOS>
youth of the city? <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
No, Pompey. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then. <EOS>
If your worship will take order for the drabs and <EOS>
the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: <EOS>
it is but heading and hanging. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
If you head and hang all that offend that way but <EOS>
for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a <EOS>
commission for more heads: if this law hold in <EOS>
Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it <EOS>
after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this <EOS>
come to pass, say Pompey told you so. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your <EOS>
prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find <EOS>
you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever; <EOS>
no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey, <EOS>
I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd <EOS>
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall <EOS>
have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
I thank your worship for your good counsel: <EOS>
but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall <EOS>
better determine. <EOS>
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade: <EOS>
The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master <EOS>
constable. How long have you been in this place of constable? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Seven year and a half, sir. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had <EOS>
continued in it some time. You say, seven years together? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
And a half, sir. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you <EOS>
wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men <EOS>
in your ward sufficient to serve it? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they <EOS>
are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I <EOS>
do it for some piece of money, and go through with <EOS>
all. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven, <EOS>
the most sufficient of your parish. <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
To your worship's house, sir? <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
To my house. Fare you well. <EOS>
What's o'clock, think you? <EOS>
Justice: <EOS>
Eleven, sir. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
I pray you home to dinner with me. <EOS>
Justice: <EOS>
I humbly thank you. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
It grieves me for the death of Claudio; <EOS>
But there's no remedy. <EOS>
Justice: <EOS>
Lord Angelo is severe. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
It is but needful: <EOS>
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so; <EOS>
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe: <EOS>
But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy. <EOS>
Come, sir. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight <EOS>
I'll tell him of you. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Pray you, do. <EOS>
I'll know <EOS>
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas, <EOS>
He hath but as offended in a dream! <EOS>
All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he <EOS>
To die for't! <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Now, what's the matter. Provost? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow? <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order? <EOS>
Why dost thou ask again? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Lest I might be too rash: <EOS>
Under your good correction, I have seen, <EOS>
When, after execution, judgment hath <EOS>
Repented o'er his doom. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Go to; let that be mine: <EOS>
Do you your office, or give up your place, <EOS>
And you shall well be spared. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
I crave your honour's pardon. <EOS>
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet? <EOS>
She's very near her hour. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Dispose of her <EOS>
To some more fitter place, and that with speed. <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd <EOS>
Desires access to you. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Hath he a sister? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid, <EOS>
And to be shortly of a sisterhood, <EOS>
If not already. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Well, let her be admitted. <EOS>
See you the fornicatress be removed: <EOS>
Let have needful, but not lavish, means; <EOS>
There shall be order for't. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
God save your honour! <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Stay a little while. <EOS>
You're welcome: what's your will? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I am a woeful suitor to your honour, <EOS>
Please but your honour hear me. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Well; what's your suit? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
There is a vice that most I do abhor, <EOS>
And most desire should meet the blow of justice; <EOS>
For which I would not plead, but that I must; <EOS>
For which I must not plead, but that I am <EOS>
At war 'twixt will and will not. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Well; the matter? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I have a brother is condemn'd to die: <EOS>
I do beseech you, let it be his fault, <EOS>
And not my brother. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it? <EOS>
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done: <EOS>
Mine were the very cipher of a function, <EOS>
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record, <EOS>
And let go by the actor. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O just but severe law! <EOS>
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour! <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Must he needs die? <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Maiden, no remedy. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Yes; I do think that you might pardon him, <EOS>
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
I will not do't. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
But can you, if you would? <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Look, what I will not, that I cannot do. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
But might you do't, and do the world no wrong, <EOS>
If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse <EOS>
As mine is to him? <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
He's sentenced; 'tis too late. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word. <EOS>
May call it back again. Well, believe this, <EOS>
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs, <EOS>
Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword, <EOS>
The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe, <EOS>
Become them with one half so good a grace <EOS>
As mercy does. <EOS>
If he had been as you and you as he, <EOS>
You would have slipt like him; but he, like you, <EOS>
Would not have been so stern. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Pray you, be gone. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I would to heaven I had your potency, <EOS>
And you were Isabel! should it then be thus? <EOS>
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge, <EOS>
And what a prisoner. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Your brother is a forfeit of the law, <EOS>
And you but waste your words. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Alas, alas! <EOS>
Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once; <EOS>
And He that might the vantage best have took <EOS>
Found out the remedy. How would you be, <EOS>
If He, which is the top of judgment, should <EOS>
But judge you as you are? O, think on that; <EOS>
And mercy then will breathe within your lips, <EOS>
Like man new made. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Be you content, fair maid; <EOS>
It is the law, not I condemn your brother: <EOS>
Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son, <EOS>
It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him! <EOS>
He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens <EOS>
We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven <EOS>
With less respect than we do minister <EOS>
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you; <EOS>
Who is it that hath died for this offence? <EOS>
There's many have committed it. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept: <EOS>
Those many had not dared to do that evil, <EOS>
If the first that did the edict infringe <EOS>
Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake <EOS>
Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet, <EOS>
Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils, <EOS>
Either new, or by remissness new-conceived, <EOS>
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born, <EOS>
Are now to have no successive degrees, <EOS>
But, ere they live, to end. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Yet show some pity. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
I show it most of all when I show justice; <EOS>
For then I pity those I do not know, <EOS>
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall; <EOS>
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong, <EOS>
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied; <EOS>
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
So you must be the first that gives this sentence, <EOS>
And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent <EOS>
To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous <EOS>
To use it like a giant. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Could great men thunder <EOS>
As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet, <EOS>
For every pelting, petty officer <EOS>
Would use his heaven for thunder; <EOS>
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven, <EOS>
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt <EOS>
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak <EOS>
Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man, <EOS>
Drest in a little brief authority, <EOS>
Most ignorant of what he's most assured, <EOS>
His glassy essence, like an angry ape, <EOS>
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven <EOS>
As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens, <EOS>
Would all themselves laugh mortal. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself: <EOS>
Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them, <EOS>
But in the less foul profanation. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
That in the captain's but a choleric word, <EOS>
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Why do you put these sayings upon me? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Because authority, though it err like others, <EOS>
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself, <EOS>
That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom; <EOS>
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know <EOS>
That's like my brother's fault: if it confess <EOS>
A natural guiltiness such as is his, <EOS>
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue <EOS>
Against my brother's life. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Gentle my lord, turn back. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
I will bethink me: come again tomorrow. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
How! bribe me? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Not with fond shekels of the tested gold, <EOS>
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor <EOS>
As fancy values them; but with true prayers <EOS>
That shall be up at heaven and enter there <EOS>
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls, <EOS>
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate <EOS>
To nothing temporal. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Well; come to me to-morrow. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Heaven keep your honour safe! <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
At what hour to-morrow <EOS>
Shall I attend your lordship? <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
At any time 'fore noon. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
'Save your honour! <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
From thee, even from thy virtue! <EOS>
What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine? <EOS>
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most? <EOS>
Ha! <EOS>
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I <EOS>
That, lying by the violet in the sun, <EOS>
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower, <EOS>
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be <EOS>
That modesty may more betray our sense <EOS>
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough, <EOS>
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary <EOS>
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie! <EOS>
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo? <EOS>
Dost thou desire her foully for those things <EOS>
That make her good? O, let her brother live! <EOS>
Thieves for their robbery have authority <EOS>
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her, <EOS>
That I desire to hear her speak again, <EOS>
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on? <EOS>
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint, <EOS>
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous <EOS>
Is that temptation that doth goad us on <EOS>
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet, <EOS>
With all her double vigour, art and nature, <EOS>
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid <EOS>
Subdues me quite. Even till now, <EOS>
When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Hail to you, provost! so I think you are. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
I am the provost. What's your will, good friar? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Bound by my charity and my blest order, <EOS>
I come to visit the afflicted spirits <EOS>
Here in the prison. Do me the common right <EOS>
To let me see them and to make me know <EOS>
The nature of their crimes, that I may minister <EOS>
To them accordingly. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
I would do more than that, if more were needful. <EOS>
Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine, <EOS>
Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth, <EOS>
Hath blister'd her report: she is with child; <EOS>
And he that got it, sentenced; a young man <EOS>
More fit to do another such offence <EOS>
Than die for this. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
When must he die? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
As I do think, to-morrow. <EOS>
I have provided for you: stay awhile, <EOS>
And you shall be conducted. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I do; and bear the shame most patiently. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience, <EOS>
And try your penitence, if it be sound, <EOS>
Or hollowly put on. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I'll gladly learn. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Love you the man that wrong'd you? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
So then it seems your most offenceful act <EOS>
Was mutually committed? <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Mutually. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his. <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I do confess it, and repent it, father. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent, <EOS>
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame, <EOS>
Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven, <EOS>
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it, <EOS>
But as we stand in fear,-- <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
I do repent me, as it is an evil, <EOS>
And take the shame with joy. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
There rest. <EOS>
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow, <EOS>
And I am going with instruction to him. <EOS>
Grace go with you, Benedicite! <EOS>
JULIET: <EOS>
Must die to-morrow! O injurious love, <EOS>
That respites me a life, whose very comfort <EOS>
Is still a dying horror! <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
'Tis pity of him. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
When I would pray and think, I think and pray <EOS>
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words; <EOS>
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue, <EOS>
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth, <EOS>
As if I did but only chew his name; <EOS>
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil <EOS>
Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied <EOS>
Is like a good thing, being often read, <EOS>
Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity, <EOS>
Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride, <EOS>
Could I with boot change for an idle plume, <EOS>
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form, <EOS>
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit, <EOS>
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls <EOS>
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood: <EOS>
Let's write good angel on the devil's horn: <EOS>
'Tis not the devil's crest. <EOS>
How now! who's there? <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Teach her the way. <EOS>
O heavens! <EOS>
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart, <EOS>
Making both it unable for itself, <EOS>
And dispossessing all my other parts <EOS>
Of necessary fitness? <EOS>
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons; <EOS>
Come all to help him, and so stop the air <EOS>
By which he should revive: and even so <EOS>
The general, subject to a well-wish'd king, <EOS>
Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness <EOS>
Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love <EOS>
Must needs appear offence. <EOS>
How now, fair maid? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I am come to know your pleasure. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
That you might know it, would much better please me <EOS>
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Even so. Heaven keep your honour! <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be, <EOS>
As long as you or I yet he must die. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Under your sentence? <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Yea. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve, <EOS>
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted <EOS>
That his soul sicken not. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good <EOS>
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen <EOS>
A man already made, as to remit <EOS>
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image <EOS>
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy <EOS>
Falsely to take away a life true made <EOS>
As to put metal in restrained means <EOS>
To make a false one. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly. <EOS>
Which had you rather, that the most just law <EOS>
Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him, <EOS>
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness <EOS>
As she that he hath stain'd? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Sir, believe this, <EOS>
I had rather give my body than my soul. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins <EOS>
Stand more for number than for accompt. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
How say you? <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak <EOS>
Against the thing I say. Answer to this: <EOS>
I, now the voice of the recorded law, <EOS>
Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life: <EOS>
Might there not be a charity in sin <EOS>
To save this brother's life? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Please you to do't, <EOS>
I'll take it as a peril to my soul, <EOS>
It is no sin at all, but charity. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul, <EOS>
Were equal poise of sin and charity. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
That I do beg his life, if it be sin, <EOS>
Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit, <EOS>
If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer <EOS>
To have it added to the faults of mine, <EOS>
And nothing of your answer. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Nay, but hear me. <EOS>
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant, <EOS>
Or seem so craftily; and that's not good. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good, <EOS>
But graciously to know I am no better. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright <EOS>
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks <EOS>
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder <EOS>
Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me; <EOS>
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross: <EOS>
Your brother is to die. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
So. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
And his offence is so, as it appears, <EOS>
Accountant to the law upon that pain. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
True. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Admit no other way to save his life,-- <EOS>
As I subscribe not that, nor any other, <EOS>
But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister, <EOS>
Finding yourself desired of such a person, <EOS>
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place, <EOS>
Could fetch your brother from the manacles <EOS>
Of the all-building law; and that there were <EOS>
No earthly mean to save him, but that either <EOS>
You must lay down the treasures of your body <EOS>
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer; <EOS>
What would you do? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
As much for my poor brother as myself: <EOS>
That is, were I under the terms of death, <EOS>
The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies, <EOS>
And strip myself to death, as to a bed <EOS>
That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield <EOS>
My body up to shame. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Then must your brother die. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
And 'twere the cheaper way: <EOS>
Better it were a brother died at once, <EOS>
Than that a sister, by redeeming him, <EOS>
Should die for ever. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence <EOS>
That you have slander'd so? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon <EOS>
Are of two houses: lawful mercy <EOS>
Is nothing kin to foul redemption. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant; <EOS>
And rather proved the sliding of your brother <EOS>
A merriment than a vice. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out, <EOS>
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean: <EOS>
I something do excuse the thing I hate, <EOS>
For his advantage that I dearly love. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
We are all frail. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Else let my brother die, <EOS>
If not a feodary, but only he <EOS>
Owe and succeed thy weakness. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Nay, women are frail too. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves; <EOS>
Which are as easy broke as they make forms. <EOS>
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar <EOS>
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail; <EOS>
For we are soft as our complexions are, <EOS>
And credulous to false prints. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
I think it well: <EOS>
And from this testimony of your own sex,-- <EOS>
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger <EOS>
Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold; <EOS>
I do arrest your words. Be that you are, <EOS>
That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none; <EOS>
If you be one, as you are well express'd <EOS>
By all external warrants, show it now, <EOS>
By putting on the destined livery. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord, <EOS>
Let me entreat you speak the former language. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Plainly conceive, I love you. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
My brother did love Juliet, <EOS>
And you tell me that he shall die for it. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I know your virtue hath a licence in't, <EOS>
Which seems a little fouler than it is, <EOS>
To pluck on others. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Believe me, on mine honour, <EOS>
My words express my purpose. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Ha! little honour to be much believed, <EOS>
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming! <EOS>
I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't: <EOS>
Sign me a present pardon for my brother, <EOS>
Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud <EOS>
What man thou art. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Who will believe thee, Isabel? <EOS>
My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life, <EOS>
My vouch against you, and my place i' the state, <EOS>
Will so your accusation overweigh, <EOS>
That you shall stifle in your own report <EOS>
And smell of calumny. I have begun, <EOS>
And now I give my sensual race the rein: <EOS>
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite; <EOS>
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes, <EOS>
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother <EOS>
By yielding up thy body to my will; <EOS>
Or else he must not only die the death, <EOS>
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out <EOS>
To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow, <EOS>
Or, by the affection that now guides me most, <EOS>
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you, <EOS>
Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
To whom should I complain? Did I tell this, <EOS>
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths, <EOS>
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue, <EOS>
Either of condemnation or approof; <EOS>
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will: <EOS>
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite, <EOS>
To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother: <EOS>
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood, <EOS>
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour. <EOS>
That, had he twenty heads to tender down <EOS>
On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up, <EOS>
Before his sister should her body stoop <EOS>
To such abhorr'd pollution. <EOS>
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die: <EOS>
More than our brother is our chastity. <EOS>
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request, <EOS>
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo? <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
The miserable have no other medicine <EOS>
But only hope: <EOS>
I've hope to live, and am prepared to die. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Be absolute for death; either death or life <EOS>
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life: <EOS>
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing <EOS>
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art, <EOS>
Servile to all the skyey influences, <EOS>
That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st, <EOS>
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool; <EOS>
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun <EOS>
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble; <EOS>
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st <EOS>
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant; <EOS>
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork <EOS>
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep, <EOS>
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st <EOS>
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself; <EOS>
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains <EOS>
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not; <EOS>
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get, <EOS>
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain; <EOS>
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects, <EOS>
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor; <EOS>
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows, <EOS>
Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey, <EOS>
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none; <EOS>
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire, <EOS>
The mere effusion of thy proper loins, <EOS>
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum, <EOS>
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age, <EOS>
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep, <EOS>
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth <EOS>
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms <EOS>
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich, <EOS>
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty, <EOS>
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this <EOS>
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life <EOS>
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear, <EOS>
That makes these odds all even. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
I humbly thank you. <EOS>
To sue to live, I find I seek to die; <EOS>
And, seeking death, find life: let it come on. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Most holy sir, I thank you. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
My business is a word or two with Claudio. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Provost, a word with you. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
As many as you please. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Now, sister, what's the comfort? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Why, <EOS>
As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed. <EOS>
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven, <EOS>
Intends you for his swift ambassador, <EOS>
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger: <EOS>
Therefore your best appointment make with speed; <EOS>
To-morrow you set on. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Is there no remedy? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
None, but such remedy as, to save a head, <EOS>
To cleave a heart in twain. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
But is there any? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Yes, brother, you may live: <EOS>
There is a devilish mercy in the judge, <EOS>
If you'll implore it, that will free your life, <EOS>
But fetter you till death. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Perpetual durance? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint, <EOS>
Though all the world's vastidity you had, <EOS>
To a determined scope. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
But in what nature? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
In such a one as, you consenting to't, <EOS>
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear, <EOS>
And leave you naked. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Let me know the point. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake, <EOS>
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain, <EOS>
And six or seven winters more respect <EOS>
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die? <EOS>
The sense of death is most in apprehension; <EOS>
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon, <EOS>
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great <EOS>
As when a giant dies. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Why give you me this shame? <EOS>
Think you I can a resolution fetch <EOS>
From flowery tenderness? If I must die, <EOS>
I will encounter darkness as a bride, <EOS>
And hug it in mine arms. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
There spake my brother; there my father's grave <EOS>
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die: <EOS>
Thou art too noble to conserve a life <EOS>
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy, <EOS>
Whose settled visage and deliberate word <EOS>
Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew <EOS>
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil <EOS>
His filth within being cast, he would appear <EOS>
A pond as deep as hell. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
The prenzie Angelo! <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell, <EOS>
The damned'st body to invest and cover <EOS>
In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio? <EOS>
If I would yield him my virginity, <EOS>
Thou mightst be freed. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
O heavens! it cannot be. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence, <EOS>
So to offend him still. This night's the time <EOS>
That I should do what I abhor to name, <EOS>
Or else thou diest to-morrow. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Thou shalt not do't. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O, were it but my life, <EOS>
I'ld throw it down for your deliverance <EOS>
As frankly as a pin. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Thanks, dear Isabel. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Yes. Has he affections in him, <EOS>
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose, <EOS>
When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin, <EOS>
Or of the deadly seven, it is the least. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Which is the least? <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
If it were damnable, he being so wise, <EOS>
Why would he for the momentary trick <EOS>
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel! <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
What says my brother? <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Death is a fearful thing. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
And shamed life a hateful. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Ay, but to die, and go we know not where; <EOS>
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot; <EOS>
This sensible warm motion to become <EOS>
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit <EOS>
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside <EOS>
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice; <EOS>
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds, <EOS>
And blown with restless violence round about <EOS>
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst <EOS>
Of those that lawless and incertain thought <EOS>
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible! <EOS>
The weariest and most loathed worldly life <EOS>
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment <EOS>
Can lay on nature is a paradise <EOS>
To what we fear of death. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Alas, alas! <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Sweet sister, let me live: <EOS>
What sin you do to save a brother's life, <EOS>
Nature dispenses with the deed so far <EOS>
That it becomes a virtue. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O you beast! <EOS>
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch! <EOS>
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice? <EOS>
Is't not a kind of incest, to take life <EOS>
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think? <EOS>
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair! <EOS>
For such a warped slip of wilderness <EOS>
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance! <EOS>
Die, perish! Might but my bending down <EOS>
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed: <EOS>
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death, <EOS>
No word to save thee. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Nay, hear me, Isabel. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O, fie, fie, fie! <EOS>
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade. <EOS>
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd: <EOS>
'Tis best thou diest quickly. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
O hear me, Isabella! <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
What is your will? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and <EOS>
by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I <EOS>
would require is likewise your own benefit. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be <EOS>
stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you <EOS>
and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to <EOS>
corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her <EOS>
virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition <EOS>
of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her, <EOS>
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most <EOS>
glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I <EOS>
know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to <EOS>
death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes <EOS>
that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to <EOS>
your knees and make ready. <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love <EOS>
with life that I will sue to be rid of it. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Hold you there: farewell. <EOS>
Provost, a word with you! <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
What's your will, father <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me <EOS>
awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my <EOS>
habit no loss shall touch her by my company. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
In good time. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good: <EOS>
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty <EOS>
brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of <EOS>
your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever <EOS>
fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you, <EOS>
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but <EOS>
that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should <EOS>
wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this <EOS>
substitute, and to save your brother? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my <EOS>
brother die by the law than my son should be <EOS>
unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke <EOS>
deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can <EOS>
speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or <EOS>
discover his government. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter <EOS>
now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made <EOS>
trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my <EOS>
advisings: to the love I have in doing good a <EOS>
remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe <EOS>
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged <EOS>
lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from <EOS>
the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious <EOS>
person; and much please the absent duke, if <EOS>
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of <EOS>
this business. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do <EOS>
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have <EOS>
you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of <EOS>
Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
She should this Angelo have married; was affianced <EOS>
to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between <EOS>
which time of the contract and limit of the <EOS>
solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea, <EOS>
having in that perished vessel the dowry of his <EOS>
sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the <EOS>
poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and <EOS>
renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most <EOS>
kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of <EOS>
her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her <EOS>
combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them <EOS>
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole, <EOS>
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few, <EOS>
bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet <EOS>
wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, <EOS>
is washed with them, but relents not. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid <EOS>
from the world! What corruption in this life, that <EOS>
it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the <EOS>
cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps <EOS>
you from dishonour in doing it. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Show me how, good father. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance <EOS>
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that <EOS>
in all reason should have quenched her love, hath, <EOS>
like an impediment in the current, made it more <EOS>
violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his <EOS>
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with <EOS>
his demands to the point; only refer yourself to <EOS>
this advantage, first, that your stay with him may <EOS>
not be long; that the time may have all shadow and <EOS>
silence in it; and the place answer to convenience. <EOS>
This being granted in course,--and now follows <EOS>
all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up <EOS>
your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter <EOS>
acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to <EOS>
her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother <EOS>
saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana <EOS>
advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid <EOS>
will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you <EOS>
think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness <EOS>
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. <EOS>
What think you of it? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
The image of it gives me content already; and I <EOS>
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily <EOS>
to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his <EOS>
bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will <EOS>
presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated <EOS>
grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that <EOS>
place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that <EOS>
it may be quickly. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father. <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will <EOS>
needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we <EOS>
shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
O heavens! what stuff is here <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the <EOS>
merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by <EOS>
order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and <EOS>
furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that <EOS>
craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing. <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
And you, good brother father. What offence hath <EOS>
this man made you, sir? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we <EOS>
take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found <EOS>
upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have <EOS>
sent to the deputy. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd! <EOS>
The evil that thou causest to be done, <EOS>
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think <EOS>
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back <EOS>
From such a filthy vice: say to thyself, <EOS>
From their abominable and beastly touches <EOS>
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live. <EOS>
Canst thou believe thy living is a life, <EOS>
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet, <EOS>
sir, I would prove-- <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin, <EOS>
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer: <EOS>
Correction and instruction must both work <EOS>
Ere this rude beast will profit. <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him <EOS>
warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if <EOS>
he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were <EOS>
as good go a mile on his errand. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
That we were all, as some would seem to be, <EOS>
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free! <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a <EOS>
friend of mine. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of <EOS>
Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there <EOS>
none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be <EOS>
had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and <EOS>
extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What <EOS>
sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't <EOS>
not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest <EOS>
thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is <EOS>
the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The <EOS>
trick of it? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Still thus, and thus; still worse! <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she <EOS>
still, ha? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she <EOS>
is herself in the tub. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be <EOS>
so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd: <EOS>
an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going <EOS>
to prison, Pompey? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Yes, faith, sir. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I <EOS>
sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
For being a bawd, for being a bawd. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the <EOS>
due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he <EOS>
doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born. <EOS>
Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison, <EOS>
Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you <EOS>
will keep the house. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. <EOS>
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If <EOS>
you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the <EOS>
more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
And you. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Come your ways, sir; come. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
You will not bail me, then, sir? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar? <EOS>
what news? <EOS>
ELBOW: <EOS>
Come your ways, sir; come. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Go to kennel, Pompey; go. <EOS>
What news, friar, of the duke? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
I know none. Can you tell me of any? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other <EOS>
some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from <EOS>
the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born <EOS>
to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he <EOS>
puts transgression to 't. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
He does well in 't. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in <EOS>
him: something too crabbed that way, friar. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; <EOS>
it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp <EOS>
it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put <EOS>
down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and <EOS>
woman after this downright way of creation: is it <EOS>
true, think you? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
How should he be made, then? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he <EOS>
was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is <EOS>
certain that when he makes water his urine is <EOS>
congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a <EOS>
motion generative; that's infallible. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the <EOS>
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a <EOS>
man! Would the duke that is absent have done this? <EOS>
Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a <EOS>
hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing <EOS>
a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he <EOS>
knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
I never heard the absent duke much detected for <EOS>
women; he was not inclined that way. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
O, sir, you are deceived. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
'Tis not possible. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and <EOS>
his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the <EOS>
duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too; <EOS>
that let me inform you. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
You do him wrong, surely. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the <EOS>
duke: and I believe I know the cause of his <EOS>
withdrawing. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
What, I prithee, might be the cause? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the <EOS>
teeth and the lips: but this I can let you <EOS>
understand, the greater file of the subject held the <EOS>
duke to be wise. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Wise! why, no question but he was. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking: <EOS>
the very stream of his life and the business he hath <EOS>
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better <EOS>
proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own <EOS>
bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the <EOS>
envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier. <EOS>
Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your <EOS>
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Sir, I know him, and I love him. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with <EOS>
dearer love. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Come, sir, I know what I know. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
I can hardly believe that, since you know not what <EOS>
you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our <EOS>
prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your <EOS>
answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke, <EOS>
you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call <EOS>
upon you; and, I pray you, your name? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to <EOS>
report you. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
I fear you not. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you <EOS>
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I <EOS>
can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me, <EOS>
friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if <EOS>
Claudio die to-morrow or no? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Why should he die, sir? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would <EOS>
the duke we talk of were returned again: the <EOS>
ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with <EOS>
continency; sparrows must not build in his <EOS>
house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke <EOS>
yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would <EOS>
never bring them to light: would he were returned! <EOS>
Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing. <EOS>
Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The <EOS>
duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on <EOS>
Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee, <EOS>
he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown <EOS>
bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
No might nor greatness in mortality <EOS>
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny <EOS>
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong <EOS>
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue? <EOS>
But who comes here? <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Go; away with her to prison! <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted <EOS>
a merciful man; good my lord. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in <EOS>
the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play <EOS>
the tyrant. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please <EOS>
your honour. <EOS>
MISTRESS OVERDONE: <EOS>
My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me. <EOS>
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the <EOS>
duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child <EOS>
is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob: <EOS>
I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me! <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be <EOS>
called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to; <EOS>
no more words. <EOS>
Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered; <EOS>
Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished <EOS>
with divines, and have all charitable preparation. <EOS>
if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be <EOS>
so with him. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
So please you, this friar hath been with him, and <EOS>
advised him for the entertainment of death. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Good even, good father. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Bliss and goodness on you! <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Of whence are you? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Not of this country, though my chance is now <EOS>
To use it for my time: I am a brother <EOS>
Of gracious order, late come from the See <EOS>
In special business from his holiness. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
What news abroad i' the world? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
None, but that there is so great a fever on <EOS>
goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it: <EOS>
novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous <EOS>
to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous <EOS>
to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce <EOS>
truth enough alive to make societies secure; but <EOS>
security enough to make fellowships accurst: much <EOS>
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This <EOS>
news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I <EOS>
pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke? <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
One that, above all other strifes, contended <EOS>
especially to know himself. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
What pleasure was he given to? <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at <EOS>
any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a <EOS>
gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to <EOS>
his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous; <EOS>
and let me desire to know how you find Claudio <EOS>
prepared. I am made to understand that you have <EOS>
lent him visitation. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
He professes to have received no sinister measure <EOS>
from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself <EOS>
to the determination of justice: yet had he framed <EOS>
to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many <EOS>
deceiving promises of life; which I by my good <EOS>
leisure have discredited to him, and now is he <EOS>
resolved to die. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
You have paid the heavens your function, and the <EOS>
prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have <EOS>
laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest <EOS>
shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I <EOS>
found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him <EOS>
he is indeed Justice. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
If his own life answer the straitness of his <EOS>
proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he <EOS>
chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Peace be with you! <EOS>
He who the sword of heaven will bear <EOS>
Should be as holy as severe; <EOS>
Pattern in himself to know, <EOS>
Grace to stand, and virtue go; <EOS>
More nor less to others paying <EOS>
Than by self-offences weighing. <EOS>
Shame to him whose cruel striking <EOS>
Kills for faults of his own liking! <EOS>
Twice treble shame on Angelo, <EOS>
To weed my vice and let his grow! <EOS>
O, what may man within him hide, <EOS>
Though angel on the outward side! <EOS>
How may likeness made in crimes, <EOS>
Making practise on the times, <EOS>
To draw with idle spiders' strings <EOS>
Most ponderous and substantial things! <EOS>
Craft against vice I must apply: <EOS>
With Angelo to-night shall lie <EOS>
His old betrothed but despised; <EOS>
So disguise shall, by the disguised, <EOS>
Pay with falsehood false exacting, <EOS>
And perform an old contracting. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away: <EOS>
Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice <EOS>
Hath often still'd my brawling discontent. <EOS>
I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish <EOS>
You had not found me here so musical: <EOS>
Let me excuse me, and believe me so, <EOS>
My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm <EOS>
To make bad good, and good provoke to harm. <EOS>
I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired <EOS>
for me here to-day? much upon this time have <EOS>
I promised here to meet. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
You have not been inquired after: <EOS>
I have sat here all day. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
I do constantly believe you. The time is come even <EOS>
now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may <EOS>
be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
I am always bound to you. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Very well met, and well come. <EOS>
What is the news from this good deputy? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
He hath a garden circummured with brick, <EOS>
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd; <EOS>
And to that vineyard is a planched gate, <EOS>
That makes his opening with this bigger key: <EOS>
This other doth command a little door <EOS>
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads; <EOS>
There have I made my promise <EOS>
Upon the heavy middle of the night <EOS>
To call upon him. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
But shall you on your knowledge find this way? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't: <EOS>
With whispering and most guilty diligence, <EOS>
In action all of precept, he did show me <EOS>
The way twice o'er. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Are there no other tokens <EOS>
Between you 'greed concerning her observance? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
No, none, but only a repair i' the dark; <EOS>
And that I have possess'd him my most stay <EOS>
Can be but brief; for I have made him know <EOS>
I have a servant comes with me along, <EOS>
That stays upon me, whose persuasion is <EOS>
I come about my brother. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
'Tis well borne up. <EOS>
I have not yet made known to Mariana <EOS>
A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth! <EOS>
I pray you, be acquainted with this maid; <EOS>
She comes to do you good. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I do desire the like. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you? <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
Good friar, I know you do, and have found it. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Take, then, this your companion by the hand, <EOS>
Who hath a story ready for your ear. <EOS>
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste; <EOS>
The vaporous night approaches. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
Will't please you walk aside? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
O place and greatness! millions of false eyes <EOS>
Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report <EOS>
Run with these false and most contrarious quests <EOS>
Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit <EOS>
Make thee the father of their idle dreams <EOS>
And rack thee in their fancies. <EOS>
Welcome, how agreed? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
She'll take the enterprise upon her, father, <EOS>
If you advise it. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
It is not my consent, <EOS>
But my entreaty too. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Little have you to say <EOS>
When you depart from him, but, soft and low, <EOS>
'Remember now my brother.' <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
Fear me not. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all. <EOS>
He is your husband on a pre-contract: <EOS>
To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin, <EOS>
Sith that the justice of your title to him <EOS>
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go: <EOS>
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a <EOS>
married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never <EOS>
cut off a woman's head. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a <EOS>
direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio <EOS>
and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common <EOS>
executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if <EOS>
you will take it on you to assist him, it shall <EOS>
redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have <EOS>
your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance <EOS>
with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a <EOS>
notorious bawd. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind; <EOS>
but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I <EOS>
would be glad to receive some instruction from my <EOS>
fellow partner. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there? <EOS>
ABHORSON: <EOS>
Do you call, sir? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in <EOS>
your execution. If you think it meet, compound with <EOS>
him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if <EOS>
not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He <EOS>
cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd. <EOS>
ABHORSON: <EOS>
A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn <EOS>
the scale. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a <EOS>
good favour you have, but that you have a hanging <EOS>
look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery? <EOS>
ABHORSON: <EOS>
Ay, sir; a mystery <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and <EOS>
your whores, sir, being members of my occupation, <EOS>
using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery: <EOS>
but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I <EOS>
should be hanged, I cannot imagine. <EOS>
ABHORSON: <EOS>
Sir, it is a mystery. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Proof? <EOS>
ABHORSON: <EOS>
Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be <EOS>
too little for your thief, your true man thinks it <EOS>
big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your <EOS>
thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's <EOS>
apparel fits your thief. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Are you agreed? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is <EOS>
a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth <EOS>
oftener ask forgiveness. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe <EOS>
to-morrow four o'clock. <EOS>
ABHORSON: <EOS>
Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have <EOS>
occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find <EOS>
me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you <EOS>
a good turn. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Call hither Barnardine and Claudio: <EOS>
The one has my pity; not a jot the other, <EOS>
Being a murderer, though he were my brother. <EOS>
Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death: <EOS>
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow <EOS>
Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine? <EOS>
CLAUDIO: <EOS>
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour <EOS>
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones: <EOS>
He will not wake. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Who can do good on him? <EOS>
Well, go, prepare yourself. <EOS>
But, hark, what noise? <EOS>
Heaven give your spirits comfort! <EOS>
By and by. <EOS>
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve <EOS>
For the most gentle Claudio. <EOS>
Welcome father. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
The best and wholesomest spirts of the night <EOS>
Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
None, since the curfew rung. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Not Isabel? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
No. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
They will, then, ere't be long. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
What comfort is for Claudio? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
There's some in hope. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
It is a bitter deputy. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd <EOS>
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice: <EOS>
He doth with holy abstinence subdue <EOS>
That in himself which he spurs on his power <EOS>
To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that <EOS>
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous; <EOS>
But this being so, he's just. <EOS>
Now are they come. <EOS>
This is a gentle provost: seldom when <EOS>
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men. <EOS>
How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste <EOS>
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
There he must stay until the officer <EOS>
Arise to let him in: he is call'd up. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet, <EOS>
But he must die to-morrow? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
None, sir, none. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
As near the dawning, provost, as it is, <EOS>
You shall hear more ere morning. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Happily <EOS>
You something know; yet I believe there comes <EOS>
No countermand; no such example have we: <EOS>
Besides, upon the very siege of justice <EOS>
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear <EOS>
Profess'd the contrary. <EOS>
This is his lordship's man. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
And here comes Claudio's pardon. <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
I shall obey him. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss <EOS>
in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted <EOS>
putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Pray you, let's hear. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the <EOS>
afternoon? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one <EOS>
that is a prisoner nine years old. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
How came it that the absent duke had not either <EOS>
delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I <EOS>
have heard it was ever his manner to do so. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and, <EOS>
indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord <EOS>
Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
It is now apparent? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Most manifest, and not denied by himself. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how <EOS>
seems he to be touched? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but <EOS>
as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless <EOS>
of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of <EOS>
mortality, and desperately mortal. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
He wants advice. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty <EOS>
of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he <EOS>
would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days <EOS>
entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if <EOS>
to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming <EOS>
warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
More of him anon. There is written in your brow, <EOS>
provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not <EOS>
truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the <EOS>
boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard. <EOS>
Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is <EOS>
no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath <EOS>
sentenced him. To make you understand this in a <EOS>
manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite; <EOS>
for the which you are to do me both a present and a <EOS>
dangerous courtesy. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Pray, sir, in what? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
In the delaying death. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited, <EOS>
and an express command, under penalty, to deliver <EOS>
his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case <EOS>
as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my <EOS>
instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine <EOS>
be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it. <EOS>
Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was <EOS>
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his <EOS>
death: you know the course is common. If any thing <EOS>
fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good <EOS>
fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead <EOS>
against it with my life. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
To him, and to his substitutes. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
You will think you have made no offence, if the duke <EOS>
avouch the justice of your dealing? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
But what likelihood is in that? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see <EOS>
you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor <EOS>
persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go <EOS>
further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you. <EOS>
Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the <EOS>
duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the <EOS>
signet is not strange to you. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
I know them both. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
The contents of this is the return of the duke: you <EOS>
shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you <EOS>
shall find, within these two days he will be here. <EOS>
This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this <EOS>
very day receives letters of strange tenor; <EOS>
perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering <EOS>
into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what <EOS>
is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the <EOS>
shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these <EOS>
things should be: all difficulties are but easy <EOS>
when they are known. Call your executioner, and off <EOS>
with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present <EOS>
shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you <EOS>
are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you. <EOS>
Come away; it is almost clear dawn. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house <EOS>
of profession: one would think it were Mistress <EOS>
Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old <EOS>
customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in <EOS>
for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger, <EOS>
ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made <EOS>
five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not <EOS>
much in request, for the old women were all dead. <EOS>
Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of <EOS>
Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of <EOS>
peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a <EOS>
beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young <EOS>
Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master <EOS>
Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young <EOS>
Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master <EOS>
Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the <EOS>
great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed <EOS>
Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in <EOS>
our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.' <EOS>
ABHORSON: <EOS>
Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged. <EOS>
Master Barnardine! <EOS>
ABHORSON: <EOS>
What, ho, Barnardine! <EOS>
BARNARDINE: <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so <EOS>
good, sir, to rise and be put to death. <EOS>
BARNARDINE: <EOS>
ABHORSON: <EOS>
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are <EOS>
executed, and sleep afterwards. <EOS>
ABHORSON: <EOS>
Go in to him, and fetch him out. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle. <EOS>
ABHORSON: <EOS>
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah? <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
Very ready, sir. <EOS>
BARNARDINE: <EOS>
How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you? <EOS>
ABHORSON: <EOS>
Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your <EOS>
prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come. <EOS>
BARNARDINE: <EOS>
You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not <EOS>
fitted for 't. <EOS>
POMPEY: <EOS>
O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night, <EOS>
and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the <EOS>
sounder all the next day. <EOS>
ABHORSON: <EOS>
Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do <EOS>
we jest now, think you? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily <EOS>
you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort <EOS>
you and pray with you. <EOS>
BARNARDINE: <EOS>
Friar, not I I have been drinking hard all night, <EOS>
and I will have more time to prepare me, or they <EOS>
shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not <EOS>
consent to die this day, that's certain. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you <EOS>
Look forward on the journey you shall go. <EOS>
BARNARDINE: <EOS>
I swear I will not die to-day for any man's <EOS>
persuasion. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
But hear you. <EOS>
BARNARDINE: <EOS>
Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me, <EOS>
come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart! <EOS>
After him, fellows; bring him to the block. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
A creature unprepared, unmeet for death; <EOS>
And to transport him in the mind he is <EOS>
Were damnable. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Here in the prison, father, <EOS>
There died this morning of a cruel fever <EOS>
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate, <EOS>
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head <EOS>
Just of his colour. What if we do omit <EOS>
This reprobate till he were well inclined; <EOS>
And satisfy the deputy with the visage <EOS>
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides! <EOS>
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on <EOS>
Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done, <EOS>
And sent according to command; whiles I <EOS>
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
This shall be done, good father, presently. <EOS>
But Barnardine must die this afternoon: <EOS>
And how shall we continue Claudio, <EOS>
To save me from the danger that might come <EOS>
If he were known alive? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Let this be done. <EOS>
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio: <EOS>
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting <EOS>
To the under generation, you shall find <EOS>
Your safety manifested. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
I am your free dependant. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo. <EOS>
Now will I write letters to Angelo,-- <EOS>
The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents <EOS>
Shall witness to him I am near at home, <EOS>
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound <EOS>
To enter publicly: him I'll desire <EOS>
To meet me at the consecrated fount <EOS>
A league below the city; and from thence, <EOS>
By cold gradation and well-balanced form, <EOS>
We shall proceed with Angelo. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Here is the head; I'll carry it myself. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Convenient is it. Make a swift return; <EOS>
For I would commune with you of such things <EOS>
That want no ear but yours. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
I'll make all speed. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know <EOS>
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither: <EOS>
But I will keep her ignorant of her good, <EOS>
To make her heavenly comforts of despair, <EOS>
When it is least expected. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Ho, by your leave! <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
The better, given me by so holy a man. <EOS>
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
He hath released him, Isabel, from the world: <EOS>
His head is off and sent to Angelo. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Nay, but it is not so. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter, <EOS>
In your close patience. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes! <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
You shall not be admitted to his sight. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel! <EOS>
Injurious world! most damned Angelo! <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot; <EOS>
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven. <EOS>
Mark what I say, which you shall find <EOS>
By every syllable a faithful verity: <EOS>
The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes; <EOS>
One of our convent, and his confessor, <EOS>
Gives me this instance: already he hath carried <EOS>
Notice to Escalus and Angelo, <EOS>
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates, <EOS>
There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom <EOS>
In that good path that I would wish it go, <EOS>
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch, <EOS>
Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart, <EOS>
And general honour. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I am directed by you. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
This letter, then, to Friar Peter give; <EOS>
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return: <EOS>
Say, by this token, I desire his company <EOS>
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours <EOS>
I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you <EOS>
Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo <EOS>
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self, <EOS>
I am combined by a sacred vow <EOS>
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter: <EOS>
Command these fretting waters from your eyes <EOS>
With a light heart; trust not my holy order, <EOS>
If I pervert your course. Who's here? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Good even. Friar, where's the provost? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Not within, sir. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see <EOS>
thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain <EOS>
to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for <EOS>
my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set <EOS>
me to 't. But they say the duke will be here <EOS>
to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother: <EOS>
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been <EOS>
at home, he had lived. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your <EOS>
reports; but the best is, he lives not in them. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do: <EOS>
he's a better woodman than thou takest him for. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee <EOS>
I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
You have told me too many of him already, sir, if <EOS>
they be true; if not true, none were enough. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
I was once before him for getting a wench with child. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Did you such a thing? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it; <EOS>
they would else have married me to the rotten medlar. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end: <EOS>
if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of <EOS>
it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions <EOS>
show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be <EOS>
not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and <EOS>
redeliver our authorities there <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
I guess not. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his <EOS>
entering, that if any crave redress of injustice, <EOS>
they should exhibit their petitions in the street? <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of <EOS>
complaints, and to deliver us from devices <EOS>
hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand <EOS>
against us. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes <EOS>
i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give <EOS>
notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet <EOS>
him. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
I shall, sir. Fare you well. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Good night. <EOS>
This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant <EOS>
And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid! <EOS>
And by an eminent body that enforced <EOS>
The law against it! But that her tender shame <EOS>
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss, <EOS>
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no; <EOS>
For my authority bears of a credent bulk, <EOS>
That no particular scandal once can touch <EOS>
But it confounds the breather. He should have lived, <EOS>
Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense, <EOS>
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge, <EOS>
By so receiving a dishonour'd life <EOS>
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived! <EOS>
A lack, when once our grace we have forgot, <EOS>
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
These letters at fit time deliver me <EOS>
The provost knows our purpose and our plot. <EOS>
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction, <EOS>
And hold you ever to our special drift; <EOS>
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that, <EOS>
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house, <EOS>
And tell him where I stay: give the like notice <EOS>
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus, <EOS>
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate; <EOS>
But send me Flavius first. <EOS>
FRIAR PETER: <EOS>
It shall be speeded well. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste: <EOS>
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends <EOS>
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
To speak so indirectly I am loath: <EOS>
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so, <EOS>
That is your part: yet I am advised to do it; <EOS>
He says, to veil full purpose. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
Be ruled by him. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure <EOS>
He speak against me on the adverse side, <EOS>
I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic <EOS>
That's bitter to sweet end. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
I would Friar Peter-- <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O, peace! the friar is come. <EOS>
FRIAR PETER: <EOS>
Come, I have found you out a stand most fit, <EOS>
Where you may have such vantage on the duke, <EOS>
He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded; <EOS>
The generous and gravest citizens <EOS>
Have hent the gates, and very near upon <EOS>
The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away! <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
My very worthy cousin, fairly met! <EOS>
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Happy return be to your royal grace! <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Many and hearty thankings to you both. <EOS>
We have made inquiry of you; and we hear <EOS>
Such goodness of your justice, that our soul <EOS>
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks, <EOS>
Forerunning more requital. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
You make my bonds still greater. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it, <EOS>
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom, <EOS>
When it deserves, with characters of brass, <EOS>
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time <EOS>
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand, <EOS>
And let the subject see, to make them know <EOS>
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim <EOS>
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus, <EOS>
You must walk by us on our other hand; <EOS>
And good supporters are you. <EOS>
FRIAR PETER: <EOS>
Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard <EOS>
Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid! <EOS>
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye <EOS>
By throwing it on any other object <EOS>
Till you have heard me in my true complaint <EOS>
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice! <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief. <EOS>
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice: <EOS>
Reveal yourself to him. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O worthy duke, <EOS>
You bid me seek redemption of the devil: <EOS>
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak <EOS>
Must either punish me, not being believed, <EOS>
Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here! <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm: <EOS>
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother <EOS>
Cut off by course of justice,-- <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
By course of justice! <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
And she will speak most bitterly and strange. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak: <EOS>
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange? <EOS>
That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange? <EOS>
That Angelo is an adulterous thief, <EOS>
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator; <EOS>
Is it not strange and strange? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Nay, it is ten times strange. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
It is not truer he is Angelo <EOS>
Than this is all as true as it is strange: <EOS>
Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth <EOS>
To the end of reckoning. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Away with her! Poor soul, <EOS>
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest <EOS>
There is another comfort than this world, <EOS>
That thou neglect me not, with that opinion <EOS>
That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible <EOS>
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible <EOS>
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground, <EOS>
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute <EOS>
As Angelo; even so may Angelo, <EOS>
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms, <EOS>
Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince: <EOS>
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more, <EOS>
Had I more name for badness. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
By mine honesty, <EOS>
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,-- <EOS>
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense, <EOS>
Such a dependency of thing on thing, <EOS>
As e'er I heard in madness. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O gracious duke, <EOS>
Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason <EOS>
For inequality; but let your reason serve <EOS>
To make the truth appear where it seems hid, <EOS>
And hide the false seems true. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Many that are not mad <EOS>
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I am the sister of one Claudio, <EOS>
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication <EOS>
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo: <EOS>
I, in probation of a sisterhood, <EOS>
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio <EOS>
As then the messenger,-- <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
That's I, an't like your grace: <EOS>
I came to her from Claudio, and desired her <EOS>
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo <EOS>
For her poor brother's pardon. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
That's he indeed. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
You were not bid to speak. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
No, my good lord; <EOS>
Nor wish'd to hold my peace. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
I wish you now, then; <EOS>
Pray you, take note of it: and when you have <EOS>
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then <EOS>
Be perfect. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
I warrant your honour. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
The warrants for yourself; take heed to't. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,-- <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Right. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong <EOS>
To speak before your time. Proceed. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I went <EOS>
To this pernicious caitiff deputy,-- <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
That's somewhat madly spoken. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Pardon it; <EOS>
The phrase is to the matter. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Mended again. The matter; proceed. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
In brief, to set the needless process by, <EOS>
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd, <EOS>
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,-- <EOS>
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion <EOS>
I now begin with grief and shame to utter: <EOS>
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body <EOS>
To his concupiscible intemperate lust, <EOS>
Release my brother; and, after much debatement, <EOS>
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour, <EOS>
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes, <EOS>
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant <EOS>
For my poor brother's head. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
This is most likely! <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O, that it were as like as it is true! <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st, <EOS>
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour <EOS>
In hateful practise. First, his integrity <EOS>
Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason <EOS>
That with such vehemency he should pursue <EOS>
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended, <EOS>
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself <EOS>
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on: <EOS>
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice <EOS>
Thou camest here to complain. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
And is this all? <EOS>
Then, O you blessed ministers above, <EOS>
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time <EOS>
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up <EOS>
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe, <EOS>
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go! <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer! <EOS>
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit <EOS>
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall <EOS>
On him so near us? This needs must be a practise. <EOS>
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither? <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar; <EOS>
I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord <EOS>
For certain words he spake against your grace <EOS>
In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Words against me? this is a good friar, belike! <EOS>
And to set on this wretched woman here <EOS>
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar, <EOS>
I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar, <EOS>
A very scurvy fellow. <EOS>
FRIAR PETER: <EOS>
Blessed be your royal grace! <EOS>
I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard <EOS>
Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman <EOS>
Most wrongfully accused your substitute, <EOS>
Who is as free from touch or soil with her <EOS>
As she from one ungot. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
We did believe no less. <EOS>
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of? <EOS>
FRIAR PETER: <EOS>
I know him for a man divine and holy; <EOS>
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler, <EOS>
As he's reported by this gentleman; <EOS>
And, on my trust, a man that never yet <EOS>
Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
My lord, most villanously; believe it. <EOS>
FRIAR PETER: <EOS>
Well, he in time may come to clear himself; <EOS>
But at this instant he is sick my lord, <EOS>
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request, <EOS>
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint <EOS>
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither, <EOS>
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know <EOS>
Is true and false; and what he with his oath <EOS>
And all probation will make up full clear, <EOS>
Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman. <EOS>
To justify this worthy nobleman, <EOS>
So vulgarly and personally accused, <EOS>
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes, <EOS>
Till she herself confess it. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Good friar, let's hear it. <EOS>
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo? <EOS>
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools! <EOS>
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo; <EOS>
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge <EOS>
Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar? <EOS>
First, let her show her face, and after speak. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face <EOS>
Until my husband bid me. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
What, are you married? <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
No, my lord. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Are you a maid? <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
No, my lord. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
A widow, then? <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
Neither, my lord. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are <EOS>
neither maid, widow, nor wife. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause <EOS>
To prattle for himself. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Well, my lord. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married; <EOS>
And I confess besides I am no maid: <EOS>
I have known my husband; yet my husband <EOS>
Knows not that ever he knew me. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too! <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Well, my lord. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
This is no witness for Lord Angelo. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
Now I come to't my lord <EOS>
She that accuses him of fornication, <EOS>
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband, <EOS>
And charges him my lord, with such a time <EOS>
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms <EOS>
With all the effect of love. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Charges she more than me? <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
Not that I know. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
No? you say your husband. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo, <EOS>
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body, <EOS>
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
My husband bids me; now I will unmask. <EOS>
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo, <EOS>
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on; <EOS>
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract, <EOS>
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body <EOS>
That took away the match from Isabel, <EOS>
And did supply thee at thy garden-house <EOS>
In her imagined person. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Know you this woman? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Carnally, she says. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Sirrah, no more! <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Enough, my lord. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
My lord, I must confess I know this woman: <EOS>
And five years since there was some speech of marriage <EOS>
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off, <EOS>
Partly for that her promised proportions <EOS>
Came short of composition, but in chief <EOS>
For that her reputation was disvalued <EOS>
In levity: since which time of five years <EOS>
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her, <EOS>
Upon my faith and honour. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
Noble prince, <EOS>
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath, <EOS>
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue, <EOS>
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly <EOS>
As words could make up vows: and, my good lord, <EOS>
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house <EOS>
He knew me as a wife. As this is true, <EOS>
Let me in safety raise me from my knees <EOS>
Or else for ever be confixed here, <EOS>
A marble monument! <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
I did but smile till now: <EOS>
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice <EOS>
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive <EOS>
These poor informal women are no more <EOS>
But instruments of some more mightier member <EOS>
That sets them on: let me have way, my lord, <EOS>
To find this practise out. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Ay, with my heart <EOS>
And punish them to your height of pleasure. <EOS>
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman, <EOS>
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths, <EOS>
Though they would swear down each particular saint, <EOS>
Were testimonies against his worth and credit <EOS>
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus, <EOS>
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains <EOS>
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived. <EOS>
There is another friar that set them on; <EOS>
Let him be sent for. <EOS>
FRIAR PETER: <EOS>
Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed <EOS>
Hath set the women on to this complaint: <EOS>
Your provost knows the place where he abides <EOS>
And he may fetch him. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Go do it instantly. <EOS>
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin, <EOS>
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth, <EOS>
Do with your injuries as seems you best, <EOS>
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you; <EOS>
But stir not you till you have well determined <EOS>
Upon these slanderers. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
My lord, we'll do it throughly. <EOS>
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that <EOS>
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing <EOS>
but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most <EOS>
villanous speeches of the duke. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and <EOS>
enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a <EOS>
notable fellow. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
As any in Vienna, on my word. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her. <EOS>
Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you <EOS>
shall see how I'll handle her. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Not better than he, by her own report. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Say you? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, <EOS>
she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly, <EOS>
she'll be ashamed. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
I will go darkly to work with her. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
That's the way; for women are light at midnight. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all <EOS>
that you have said. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with <EOS>
the provost. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
In very good time: speak not you to him till we <EOS>
call upon you. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Mum. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander <EOS>
Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
'Tis false. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
How! know you where you are? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Respect to your great place! and let the devil <EOS>
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne! <EOS>
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak: <EOS>
Look you speak justly. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls, <EOS>
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox? <EOS>
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone? <EOS>
Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust, <EOS>
Thus to retort your manifest appeal, <EOS>
And put your trial in the villain's mouth <EOS>
Which here you come to accuse. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar, <EOS>
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women <EOS>
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth <EOS>
And in the witness of his proper ear, <EOS>
To call him villain? and then to glance from him <EOS>
To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice? <EOS>
Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you <EOS>
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose. <EOS>
What 'unjust'! <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Be not so hot; the duke <EOS>
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he <EOS>
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not, <EOS>
Nor here provincial. My business in this state <EOS>
Made me a looker on here in Vienna, <EOS>
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble <EOS>
Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults, <EOS>
But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes <EOS>
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop, <EOS>
As much in mock as mark. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Slander to the state! Away with him to prison! <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio? <EOS>
Is this the man that you did tell us of? <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate: <EOS>
do you know me? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I <EOS>
met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Most notedly, sir. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a <EOS>
fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make <EOS>
that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and <EOS>
much more, much worse. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the <EOS>
nose for thy speeches? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
I protest I love the duke as I love myself. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
Hark, how the villain would close now, after his <EOS>
treasonable abuses! <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with <EOS>
him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him <EOS>
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him <EOS>
speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and <EOS>
with the other confederate companion! <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you <EOS>
bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must <EOS>
you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you! <EOS>
show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour! <EOS>
Will't not off? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke. <EOS>
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three. <EOS>
Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you <EOS>
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
This may prove worse than hanging. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
O my dread lord, <EOS>
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness, <EOS>
To think I can be undiscernible, <EOS>
When I perceive your grace, like power divine, <EOS>
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince, <EOS>
No longer session hold upon my shame, <EOS>
But let my trial be mine own confession: <EOS>
Immediate sentence then and sequent death <EOS>
Is all the grace I beg. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Come hither, Mariana. <EOS>
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman? <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
I was, my lord. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Go take her hence, and marry her instantly. <EOS>
Do you the office, friar; which consummate, <EOS>
Return him here again. Go with him, provost. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour <EOS>
Than at the strangeness of it. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Come hither, Isabel. <EOS>
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then <EOS>
Advertising and holy to your business, <EOS>
Not changing heart with habit, I am still <EOS>
Attorney'd at your service. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
O, give me pardon, <EOS>
That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd <EOS>
Your unknown sovereignty! <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
You are pardon'd, Isabel: <EOS>
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us. <EOS>
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart; <EOS>
And you may marvel why I obscured myself, <EOS>
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather <EOS>
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power <EOS>
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid, <EOS>
It was the swift celerity of his death, <EOS>
Which I did think with slower foot came on, <EOS>
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him! <EOS>
That life is better life, past fearing death, <EOS>
Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort, <EOS>
So happy is your brother. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
I do, my lord. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
For this new-married man approaching here, <EOS>
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd <EOS>
Your well defended honour, you must pardon <EOS>
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,-- <EOS>
Being criminal, in double violation <EOS>
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach <EOS>
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,-- <EOS>
The very mercy of the law cries out <EOS>
Most audible, even from his proper tongue, <EOS>
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!' <EOS>
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure; <EOS>
Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE. <EOS>
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested; <EOS>
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage. <EOS>
We do condemn thee to the very block <EOS>
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste. <EOS>
Away with him! <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
O my most gracious lord, <EOS>
I hope you will not mock me with a husband. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband. <EOS>
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour, <EOS>
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation, <EOS>
For that he knew you, might reproach your life <EOS>
And choke your good to come; for his possessions, <EOS>
Although by confiscation they are ours, <EOS>
We do instate and widow you withal, <EOS>
To buy you a better husband. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
O my dear lord, <EOS>
I crave no other, nor no better man. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Never crave him; we are definitive. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
Gentle my liege,-- <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
You do but lose your labour. <EOS>
Away with him to death! <EOS>
Now, sir, to you. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part; <EOS>
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come <EOS>
I'll lend you all my life to do you service. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Against all sense you do importune her: <EOS>
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact, <EOS>
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break, <EOS>
And take her hence in horror. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
Isabel, <EOS>
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me; <EOS>
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all. <EOS>
They say, best men are moulded out of faults; <EOS>
And, for the most, become much more the better <EOS>
For being a little bad: so may my husband. <EOS>
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee? <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
He dies for Claudio's death. <EOS>
ISABELLA: <EOS>
Most bounteous sir, <EOS>
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd, <EOS>
As if my brother lived: I partly think <EOS>
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds, <EOS>
Till he did look on me: since it is so, <EOS>
Let him not die. My brother had but justice, <EOS>
In that he did the thing for which he died: <EOS>
For Angelo, <EOS>
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent, <EOS>
And must be buried but as an intent <EOS>
That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects; <EOS>
Intents but merely thoughts. <EOS>
MARIANA: <EOS>
Merely, my lord. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say. <EOS>
I have bethought me of another fault. <EOS>
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded <EOS>
At an unusual hour? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
It was commanded so. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Had you a special warrant for the deed? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
No, my good lord; it was by private message. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
For which I do discharge you of your office: <EOS>
Give up your keys. <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
Pardon me, noble lord: <EOS>
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not; <EOS>
Yet did repent me, after more advice; <EOS>
For testimony whereof, one in the prison, <EOS>
That should by private order else have died, <EOS>
I have reserved alive. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
What's he? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
His name is Barnardine. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio. <EOS>
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him. <EOS>
ESCALUS: <EOS>
I am sorry, one so learned and so wise <EOS>
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd, <EOS>
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood. <EOS>
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward. <EOS>
ANGELO: <EOS>
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure: <EOS>
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart <EOS>
That I crave death more willingly than mercy; <EOS>
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Which is that Barnardine? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
This, my lord. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
There was a friar told me of this man. <EOS>
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul. <EOS>
That apprehends no further than this world, <EOS>
And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd: <EOS>
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all; <EOS>
And pray thee take this mercy to provide <EOS>
For better times to come. Friar, advise him; <EOS>
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that? <EOS>
Provost: <EOS>
This is another prisoner that I saved. <EOS>
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head; <EOS>
As like almost to Claudio as himself. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the <EOS>
trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I <EOS>
had rather it would please you I might be whipt. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Whipt first, sir, and hanged after. <EOS>
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city. <EOS>
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow, <EOS>
As I have heard him swear himself there's one <EOS>
Whom he begot with child, let her appear, <EOS>
And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd, <EOS>
Let him be whipt and hang'd. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore. <EOS>
Your highness said even now, I made you a duke: <EOS>
good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her. <EOS>
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal <EOS>
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison; <EOS>
And see our pleasure herein executed. <EOS>
LUCIO: <EOS>
Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, <EOS>
whipping, and hanging. <EOS>
DUKE VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Slandering a prince deserves it. <EOS>
She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore. <EOS>
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo: <EOS>
I have confess'd her and I know her virtue. <EOS>
Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness: <EOS>
There's more behind that is more gratulate. <EOS>
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy: <EOS>
We shill employ thee in a worthier place. <EOS>
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home <EOS>
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's: <EOS>
The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel, <EOS>
I have a motion much imports your good; <EOS>
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline, <EOS>
What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine. <EOS>
So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show <EOS>
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
I'll pheeze you, in faith. <EOS>
Hostess: <EOS>
A pair of stocks, you rogue! <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in <EOS>
the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror. <EOS>
Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa! <EOS>
Hostess: <EOS>
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst? <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold <EOS>
bed, and warm thee. <EOS>
Hostess: <EOS>
I know my remedy; I must go fetch the <EOS>
third--borough. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him <EOS>
by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come, <EOS>
and kindly. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds: <EOS>
Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd; <EOS>
And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach. <EOS>
Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good <EOS>
At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault? <EOS>
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound. <EOS>
First Huntsman: <EOS>
Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord; <EOS>
He cried upon it at the merest loss <EOS>
And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent: <EOS>
Trust me, I take him for the better dog. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet, <EOS>
I would esteem him worth a dozen such. <EOS>
But sup them well and look unto them all: <EOS>
To-morrow I intend to hunt again. <EOS>
First Huntsman: <EOS>
I will, my lord. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe? <EOS>
Second Huntsman: <EOS>
He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale, <EOS>
This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies! <EOS>
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image! <EOS>
Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man. <EOS>
What think you, if he were convey'd to bed, <EOS>
Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers, <EOS>
A most delicious banquet by his bed, <EOS>
And brave attendants near him when he wakes, <EOS>
Would not the beggar then forget himself? <EOS>
First Huntsman: <EOS>
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose. <EOS>
Second Huntsman: <EOS>
It would seem strange unto him when he waked. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy. <EOS>
Then take him up and manage well the jest: <EOS>
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber <EOS>
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures: <EOS>
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters <EOS>
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet: <EOS>
Procure me music ready when he wakes, <EOS>
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound; <EOS>
And if he chance to speak, be ready straight <EOS>
And with a low submissive reverence <EOS>
Say 'What is it your honour will command?' <EOS>
Let one attend him with a silver basin <EOS>
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers, <EOS>
Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper, <EOS>
And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?' <EOS>
Some one be ready with a costly suit <EOS>
And ask him what apparel he will wear; <EOS>
Another tell him of his hounds and horse, <EOS>
And that his lady mourns at his disease: <EOS>
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic; <EOS>
And when he says he is, say that he dreams, <EOS>
For he is nothing but a mighty lord. <EOS>
This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs: <EOS>
It will be pastime passing excellent, <EOS>
If it be husbanded with modesty. <EOS>
First Huntsman: <EOS>
My lord, I warrant you we will play our part, <EOS>
As he shall think by our true diligence <EOS>
He is no less than what we say he is. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Take him up gently and to bed with him; <EOS>
And each one to his office when he wakes. <EOS>
Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds: <EOS>
Belike, some noble gentleman that means, <EOS>
Travelling some journey, to repose him here. <EOS>
How now! who is it? <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
An't please your honour, players <EOS>
That offer service to your lordship. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Bid them come near. <EOS>
Now, fellows, you are welcome. <EOS>
Players: <EOS>
We thank your honour. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Do you intend to stay with me tonight? <EOS>
A Player: <EOS>
So please your lordship to accept our duty. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
With all my heart. This fellow I remember, <EOS>
Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son: <EOS>
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well: <EOS>
I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part <EOS>
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd. <EOS>
A Player: <EOS>
I think 'twas Soto that your honour means. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent. <EOS>
Well, you are come to me in a happy time; <EOS>
The rather for I have some sport in hand <EOS>
Wherein your cunning can assist me much. <EOS>
There is a lord will hear you play to-night: <EOS>
But I am doubtful of your modesties; <EOS>
Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,-- <EOS>
For yet his honour never heard a play-- <EOS>
You break into some merry passion <EOS>
And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs, <EOS>
If you should smile he grows impatient. <EOS>
A Player: <EOS>
Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves, <EOS>
Were he the veriest antic in the world. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery, <EOS>
And give them friendly welcome every one: <EOS>
Let them want nothing that my house affords. <EOS>
Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page, <EOS>
And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady: <EOS>
That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber; <EOS>
And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance. <EOS>
Tell him from me, as he will win my love, <EOS>
He bear himself with honourable action, <EOS>
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies <EOS>
Unto their lords, by them accomplished: <EOS>
Such duty to the drunkard let him do <EOS>
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy, <EOS>
And say 'What is't your honour will command, <EOS>
Wherein your lady and your humble wife <EOS>
May show her duty and make known her love?' <EOS>
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses, <EOS>
And with declining head into his bosom, <EOS>
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd <EOS>
To see her noble lord restored to health, <EOS>
Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him <EOS>
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar: <EOS>
And if the boy have not a woman's gift <EOS>
To rain a shower of commanded tears, <EOS>
An onion will do well for such a shift, <EOS>
Which in a napkin being close convey'd <EOS>
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye. <EOS>
See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst: <EOS>
Anon I'll give thee more instructions. <EOS>
I know the boy will well usurp the grace, <EOS>
Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman: <EOS>
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband, <EOS>
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter <EOS>
When they do homage to this simple peasant. <EOS>
I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence <EOS>
May well abate the over-merry spleen <EOS>
Which otherwise would grow into extremes. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
For God's sake, a pot of small ale. <EOS>
First Servant: <EOS>
Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack? <EOS>
Second Servant: <EOS>
Will't please your honour taste of these conserves? <EOS>
Third Servant: <EOS>
What raiment will your honour wear to-day? <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor <EOS>
'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if <EOS>
you give me any conserves, give me conserves of <EOS>
beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I <EOS>
have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings <EOS>
than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay, <EOS>
sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my <EOS>
toes look through the over-leather. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour! <EOS>
O, that a mighty man of such descent, <EOS>
Of such possessions and so high esteem, <EOS>
Should be infused with so foul a spirit! <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher <EOS>
Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a <EOS>
pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a <EOS>
bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? <EOS>
Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if <EOS>
she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence <EOS>
on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the <EOS>
lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not <EOS>
bestraught: here's-- <EOS>
Third Servant: <EOS>
O, this it is that makes your lady mourn! <EOS>
Second Servant: <EOS>
O, this is it that makes your servants droop! <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house, <EOS>
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy. <EOS>
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth, <EOS>
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment <EOS>
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams. <EOS>
Look how thy servants do attend on thee, <EOS>
Each in his office ready at thy beck. <EOS>
Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays, <EOS>
And twenty caged nightingales do sing: <EOS>
Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch <EOS>
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed <EOS>
On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis. <EOS>
Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground: <EOS>
Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd, <EOS>
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl. <EOS>
Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar <EOS>
Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt? <EOS>
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them <EOS>
And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth. <EOS>
First Servant: <EOS>
Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift <EOS>
As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe. <EOS>
Second Servant: <EOS>
Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight <EOS>
Adonis painted by a running brook, <EOS>
And Cytherea all in sedges hid, <EOS>
Which seem to move and wanton with her breath, <EOS>
Even as the waving sedges play with wind. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
We'll show thee Io as she was a maid, <EOS>
And how she was beguiled and surprised, <EOS>
As lively painted as the deed was done. <EOS>
Third Servant: <EOS>
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood, <EOS>
Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds, <EOS>
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep, <EOS>
So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn. <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord: <EOS>
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful <EOS>
Than any woman in this waning age. <EOS>
First Servant: <EOS>
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee <EOS>
Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face, <EOS>
She was the fairest creature in the world; <EOS>
And yet she is inferior to none. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
Am I a lord? and have I such a lady? <EOS>
Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now? <EOS>
I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak; <EOS>
I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things: <EOS>
Upon my life, I am a lord indeed <EOS>
And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly. <EOS>
Well, bring our lady hither to our sight; <EOS>
And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale. <EOS>
Second Servant: <EOS>
Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands? <EOS>
O, how we joy to see your wit restored! <EOS>
O, that once more you knew but what you are! <EOS>
These fifteen years you have been in a dream; <EOS>
Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap. <EOS>
But did I never speak of all that time? <EOS>
First Servant: <EOS>
O, yes, my lord, but very idle words: <EOS>
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber, <EOS>
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door; <EOS>
And rail upon the hostess of the house; <EOS>
And say you would present her at the leet, <EOS>
Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts: <EOS>
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
Ay, the woman's maid of the house. <EOS>
Third Servant: <EOS>
Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid, <EOS>
Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up, <EOS>
As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece <EOS>
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell <EOS>
And twenty more such names and men as these <EOS>
Which never were nor no man ever saw. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends! <EOS>
ALL: <EOS>
Amen. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it. <EOS>
Page: <EOS>
How fares my noble lord? <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
Marry, I fare well for here is cheer enough. <EOS>
Where is my wife? <EOS>
Page: <EOS>
Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her? <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
Are you my wife and will not call me husband? <EOS>
My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman. <EOS>
Page: <EOS>
My husband and my lord, my lord and husband; <EOS>
I am your wife in all obedience. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
I know it well. What must I call her? <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
Madam. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
Al'ce madam, or Joan madam? <EOS>
Lord: <EOS>
'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords <EOS>
call ladies. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd <EOS>
And slept above some fifteen year or more. <EOS>
Page: <EOS>
Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me, <EOS>
Being all this time abandon'd from your bed. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone. <EOS>
Madam, undress you and come now to bed. <EOS>
Page: <EOS>
Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you <EOS>
To pardon me yet for a night or two, <EOS>
Or, if not so, until the sun be set: <EOS>
For your physicians have expressly charged, <EOS>
In peril to incur your former malady, <EOS>
That I should yet absent me from your bed: <EOS>
I hope this reason stands for my excuse. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
Ay, it stands so that I may hardly <EOS>
tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into <EOS>
my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in <EOS>
despite of the flesh and the blood. <EOS>
Messenger: <EOS>
Your honour's players, heating your amendment, <EOS>
Are come to play a pleasant comedy; <EOS>
For so your doctors hold it very meet, <EOS>
Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood, <EOS>
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy: <EOS>
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play <EOS>
And frame your mind to mirth and merriment, <EOS>
Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a <EOS>
comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick? <EOS>
Page: <EOS>
No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
What, household stuff? <EOS>
Page: <EOS>
It is a kind of history. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
Well, well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side <EOS>
and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Tranio, since for the great desire I had <EOS>
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts, <EOS>
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy, <EOS>
The pleasant garden of great Italy; <EOS>
And by my father's love and leave am arm'd <EOS>
With his good will and thy good company, <EOS>
My trusty servant, well approved in all, <EOS>
Here let us breathe and haply institute <EOS>
A course of learning and ingenious studies. <EOS>
Pisa renown'd for grave citizens <EOS>
Gave me my being and my father first, <EOS>
A merchant of great traffic through the world, <EOS>
Vincetino come of Bentivolii. <EOS>
Vincetino's son brought up in Florence <EOS>
It shall become to serve all hopes conceived, <EOS>
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds: <EOS>
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study, <EOS>
Virtue and that part of philosophy <EOS>
Will I apply that treats of happiness <EOS>
By virtue specially to be achieved. <EOS>
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left <EOS>
And am to Padua come, as he that leaves <EOS>
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep <EOS>
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Mi perdonato, gentle master mine, <EOS>
I am in all affected as yourself; <EOS>
Glad that you thus continue your resolve <EOS>
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy. <EOS>
Only, good master, while we do admire <EOS>
This virtue and this moral discipline, <EOS>
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray; <EOS>
Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques <EOS>
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured: <EOS>
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have <EOS>
And practise rhetoric in your common talk; <EOS>
Music and poesy use to quicken you; <EOS>
The mathematics and the metaphysics, <EOS>
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you; <EOS>
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en: <EOS>
In brief, sir, study what you most affect. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise. <EOS>
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore, <EOS>
We could at once put us in readiness, <EOS>
And take a lodging fit to entertain <EOS>
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget. <EOS>
But stay a while: what company is this? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Master, some show to welcome us to town. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Gentlemen, importune me no farther, <EOS>
For how I firmly am resolved you know; <EOS>
That is, not bestow my youngest daughter <EOS>
Before I have a husband for the elder: <EOS>
If either of you both love Katharina, <EOS>
Because I know you well and love you well, <EOS>
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I pray you, sir, is it your will <EOS>
To make a stale of me amongst these mates? <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you, <EOS>
Unless you were of gentler, milder mould. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear: <EOS>
I wis it is not half way to her heart; <EOS>
But if it were, doubt not her care should be <EOS>
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool <EOS>
And paint your face and use you like a fool. <EOS>
HORTENSIA: <EOS>
From all such devils, good Lord deliver us! <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
And me too, good Lord! <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward: <EOS>
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
But in the other's silence do I see <EOS>
Maid's mild behavior and sobriety. <EOS>
Peace, Tranio! <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Gentlemen, that I may soon make good <EOS>
What I have said, Bianca, get you in: <EOS>
And let it not displease thee, good Bianca, <EOS>
For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
A pretty peat! it is best <EOS>
Put finger in the eye, an she knew why. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Sister, content you in my discontent. <EOS>
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe: <EOS>
My books and instruments shall be my company, <EOS>
On them to took and practise by myself. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Signior Baptista, will you be so strange? <EOS>
Sorry am I that our good will effects <EOS>
Bianca's grief. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Why will you mew her up, <EOS>
Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell, <EOS>
And make her bear the penance of her tongue? <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved: <EOS>
Go in, Bianca: <EOS>
And for I know she taketh most delight <EOS>
In music, instruments and poetry, <EOS>
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house, <EOS>
Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio, <EOS>
Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such, <EOS>
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men <EOS>
I will be very kind, and liberal <EOS>
To mine own children in good bringing up: <EOS>
And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay; <EOS>
For I have more to commune with Bianca. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What, <EOS>
shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I <EOS>
knew not what to take and what to leave, ha? <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so <EOS>
good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not <EOS>
so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails <EOS>
together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on <EOS>
both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my <EOS>
sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit <EOS>
man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will <EOS>
wish him to her father. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray. <EOS>
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked <EOS>
parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both, <EOS>
that we may yet again have access to our fair <EOS>
mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to <EOS>
labour and effect one thing specially. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
What's that, I pray? <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
A husband! a devil. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
I say, a husband. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though <EOS>
her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool <EOS>
to be married to hell? <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine <EOS>
to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good <EOS>
fellows in the world, an a man could light on them, <EOS>
would take her with all faults, and money enough. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with <EOS>
this condition, to be whipped at the high cross <EOS>
every morning. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten <EOS>
apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us <EOS>
friends, it shall be so far forth friendly <EOS>
maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter <EOS>
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband, <EOS>
and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man <EOS>
be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. <EOS>
How say you, Signior Gremio? <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
I am agreed; and would I had given him the best <EOS>
horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would <EOS>
thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the <EOS>
house of her! Come on. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible <EOS>
That love should of a sudden take such hold? <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
O Tranio, till I found it to be true, <EOS>
I never thought it possible or likely; <EOS>
But see, while idly I stood looking on, <EOS>
I found the effect of love in idleness: <EOS>
And now in plainness do confess to thee, <EOS>
That art to me as secret and as dear <EOS>
As Anna to the queen of Carthage was, <EOS>
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio, <EOS>
If I achieve not this young modest girl. <EOS>
Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst; <EOS>
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Master, it is no time to chide you now; <EOS>
Affection is not rated from the heart: <EOS>
If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so, <EOS>
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.' <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents: <EOS>
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Master, you look'd so longly on the maid, <EOS>
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face, <EOS>
Such as the daughter of Agenor had, <EOS>
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand. <EOS>
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister <EOS>
Began to scold and raise up such a storm <EOS>
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din? <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move <EOS>
And with her breath she did perfume the air: <EOS>
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance. <EOS>
I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid, <EOS>
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands: <EOS>
Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd <EOS>
That till the father rid his hands of her, <EOS>
Master, your love must live a maid at home; <EOS>
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up, <EOS>
Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he! <EOS>
But art thou not advised, he took some care <EOS>
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
I have it, Tranio. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Master, for my hand, <EOS>
Both our inventions meet and jump in one. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Tell me thine first. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
You will be schoolmaster <EOS>
And undertake the teaching of the maid: <EOS>
That's your device. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
It is: may it be done? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Not possible; for who shall bear your part, <EOS>
And be in Padua here Vincentio's son, <EOS>
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends, <EOS>
Visit his countrymen and banquet them? <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Basta; content thee, for I have it full. <EOS>
We have not yet been seen in any house, <EOS>
Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces <EOS>
For man or master; then it follows thus; <EOS>
Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead, <EOS>
Keep house and port and servants as I should: <EOS>
I will some other be, some Florentine, <EOS>
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa. <EOS>
'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once <EOS>
Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak: <EOS>
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee; <EOS>
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
So had you need. <EOS>
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is, <EOS>
And I am tied to be obedient; <EOS>
For so your father charged me at our parting, <EOS>
'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he, <EOS>
Although I think 'twas in another sense; <EOS>
I am content to be Lucentio, <EOS>
Because so well I love Lucentio. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves: <EOS>
And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid <EOS>
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye. <EOS>
Here comes the rogue. <EOS>
Sirrah, where have you been? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you? <EOS>
Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or <EOS>
you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news? <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest, <EOS>
And therefore frame your manners to the time. <EOS>
Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life, <EOS>
Puts my apparel and my countenance on, <EOS>
And I for my escape have put on his; <EOS>
For in a quarrel since I came ashore <EOS>
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried: <EOS>
Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes, <EOS>
While I make way from hence to save my life: <EOS>
You understand me? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
I, sir! ne'er a whit. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth: <EOS>
Tranio is changed into Lucentio. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
The better for him: would I were so too! <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after, <EOS>
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter. <EOS>
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise <EOS>
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies: <EOS>
When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio; <EOS>
But in all places else your master Lucentio. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that <EOS>
thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if <EOS>
thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good <EOS>
and weighty. <EOS>
First Servant: <EOS>
My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely: <EOS>
comes there any more of it? <EOS>
Page: <EOS>
My lord, 'tis but begun. <EOS>
SLY: <EOS>
'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady: <EOS>
would 'twere done! <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Verona, for a while I take my leave, <EOS>
To see my friends in Padua, but of all <EOS>
My best beloved and approved friend, <EOS>
Hortensio; and I trow this is his house. <EOS>
Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has <EOS>
rebused your worship? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Villain, I say, knock me here soundly. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that <EOS>
I should knock you here, sir? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate <EOS>
And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock <EOS>
you first, <EOS>
And then I know after who comes by the worst. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Will it not be? <EOS>
Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it; <EOS>
I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Help, masters, help! my master is mad. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain! <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio! <EOS>
and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray? <EOS>
'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor <EOS>
mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound <EOS>
this quarrel. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin. <EOS>
if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his <EOS>
service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap <EOS>
him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to <EOS>
use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see, <EOS>
two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had <EOS>
well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
A senseless villain! Good Hortensio, <EOS>
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate <EOS>
And could not get him for my heart to do it. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these <EOS>
words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here, <EOS>
knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you <EOS>
now with, 'knocking at the gate'? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge: <EOS>
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you, <EOS>
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio. <EOS>
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale <EOS>
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Such wind as scatters young men through the world, <EOS>
To seek their fortunes farther than at home <EOS>
Where small experience grows. But in a few, <EOS>
Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me: <EOS>
Antonio, my father, is deceased; <EOS>
And I have thrust myself into this maze, <EOS>
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may: <EOS>
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home, <EOS>
And so am come abroad to see the world. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee <EOS>
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife? <EOS>
Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel: <EOS>
And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich <EOS>
And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend, <EOS>
And I'll not wish thee to her. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we <EOS>
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know <EOS>
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife, <EOS>
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance, <EOS>
Be she as foul as was Florentius' love, <EOS>
As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd <EOS>
As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse, <EOS>
She moves me not, or not removes, at least, <EOS>
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough <EOS>
As are the swelling Adriatic seas: <EOS>
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua; <EOS>
If wealthily, then happily in Padua. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his <EOS>
mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to <EOS>
a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er <EOS>
a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases <EOS>
as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss, <EOS>
so money comes withal. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in, <EOS>
I will continue that I broach'd in jest. <EOS>
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife <EOS>
With wealth enough and young and beauteous, <EOS>
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman: <EOS>
Her only fault, and that is faults enough, <EOS>
Is that she is intolerable curst <EOS>
And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure <EOS>
That, were my state far worser than it is, <EOS>
I would not wed her for a mine of gold. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect: <EOS>
Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough; <EOS>
For I will board her, though she chide as loud <EOS>
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Her father is Baptista Minola, <EOS>
An affable and courteous gentleman: <EOS>
Her name is Katharina Minola, <EOS>
Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
I know her father, though I know not her; <EOS>
And he knew my deceased father well. <EOS>
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her; <EOS>
And therefore let me be thus bold with you <EOS>
To give you over at this first encounter, <EOS>
Unless you will accompany me thither. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. <EOS>
O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she <EOS>
would think scolding would do little good upon him: <EOS>
she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so: <EOS>
why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in <EOS>
his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she <EOS>
stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in <EOS>
her face and so disfigure her with it that she <EOS>
shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat. <EOS>
You know him not, sir. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee, <EOS>
For in Baptista's keep my treasure is: <EOS>
He hath the jewel of my life in hold, <EOS>
His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca, <EOS>
And her withholds from me and other more, <EOS>
Suitors to her and rivals in my love, <EOS>
Supposing it a thing impossible, <EOS>
For those defects I have before rehearsed, <EOS>
That ever Katharina will be woo'd; <EOS>
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en, <EOS>
That none shall have access unto Bianca <EOS>
Till Katharina the curst have got a husband. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Katharina the curst! <EOS>
A title for a maid of all titles the worst. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace, <EOS>
And offer me disguised in sober robes <EOS>
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster <EOS>
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca; <EOS>
That so I may, by this device, at least <EOS>
Have leave and leisure to make love to her <EOS>
And unsuspected court her by herself. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, <EOS>
how the young folks lay their heads together! <EOS>
Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha? <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love. <EOS>
Petruchio, stand by a while. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
A proper stripling and an amorous! <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
O, very well; I have perused the note. <EOS>
Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound: <EOS>
All books of love, see that at any hand; <EOS>
And see you read no other lectures to her: <EOS>
You understand me: over and beside <EOS>
Signior Baptista's liberality, <EOS>
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too, <EOS>
And let me have them very well perfumed <EOS>
For she is sweeter than perfume itself <EOS>
To whom they go to. What will you read to her? <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you <EOS>
As for my patron, stand you so assured, <EOS>
As firmly as yourself were still in place: <EOS>
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words <EOS>
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
O this learning, what a thing it is! <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
O this woodcock, what an ass it is! <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Peace, sirrah! <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
And you are well met, Signior Hortensio. <EOS>
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola. <EOS>
I promised to inquire carefully <EOS>
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca: <EOS>
And by good fortune I have lighted well <EOS>
On this young man, for learning and behavior <EOS>
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry <EOS>
And other books, good ones, I warrant ye. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman <EOS>
Hath promised me to help me to another, <EOS>
A fine musician to instruct our mistress; <EOS>
So shall I no whit be behind in duty <EOS>
To fair Bianca, so beloved of me. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
And that his bags shall prove. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love: <EOS>
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair, <EOS>
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either. <EOS>
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met, <EOS>
Upon agreement from us to his liking, <EOS>
Will undertake to woo curst Katharina, <EOS>
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
So said, so done, is well. <EOS>
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
I know she is an irksome brawling scold: <EOS>
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Born in Verona, old Antonio's son: <EOS>
My father dead, my fortune lives for me; <EOS>
And I do hope good days and long to see. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange! <EOS>
But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name: <EOS>
You shall have me assisting you in all. <EOS>
But will you woo this wild-cat? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Will I live? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Why came I hither but to that intent? <EOS>
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears? <EOS>
Have I not in my time heard lions roar? <EOS>
Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds <EOS>
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat? <EOS>
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field, <EOS>
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies? <EOS>
Have I not in a pitched battle heard <EOS>
Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang? <EOS>
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue, <EOS>
That gives not half so great a blow to hear <EOS>
As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire? <EOS>
Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
For he fears none. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Hortensio, hark: <EOS>
This gentleman is happily arrived, <EOS>
My mind presumes, for his own good and ours. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
I promised we would be contributors <EOS>
And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
And so we will, provided that he win her. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
I would I were as sure of a good dinner. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold, <EOS>
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way <EOS>
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Even he, Biondello. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Hark you, sir; you mean not her to-- <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Well begun, Tranio. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Sir, a word ere you go; <EOS>
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
And if I be, sir, is it any offence? <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
No; if without more words you will get you hence. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free <EOS>
For me as for you? <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
But so is not she. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
For what reason, I beseech you? <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
For this reason, if you'll know, <EOS>
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen, <EOS>
Do me this right; hear me with patience. <EOS>
Baptista is a noble gentleman, <EOS>
To whom my father is not all unknown; <EOS>
And were his daughter fairer than she is, <EOS>
She may more suitors have and me for one. <EOS>
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers; <EOS>
Then well one more may fair Bianca have: <EOS>
And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one, <EOS>
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
What! this gentleman will out-talk us all. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Hortensio, to what end are all these words? <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Sir, let me be so bold as ask you, <EOS>
Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two, <EOS>
The one as famous for a scolding tongue <EOS>
As is the other for beauteous modesty. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules; <EOS>
And let it be more than Alcides' twelve. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Sir, understand you this of me in sooth: <EOS>
The youngest daughter whom you hearken for <EOS>
Her father keeps from all access of suitors, <EOS>
And will not promise her to any man <EOS>
Until the elder sister first be wed: <EOS>
The younger then is free and not before. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
If it be so, sir, that you are the man <EOS>
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest, <EOS>
And if you break the ice and do this feat, <EOS>
Achieve the elder, set the younger free <EOS>
For our access, whose hap shall be to have her <EOS>
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Sir, you say well and well you do conceive; <EOS>
And since you do profess to be a suitor, <EOS>
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman, <EOS>
To whom we all rest generally beholding. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof, <EOS>
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon, <EOS>
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health, <EOS>
And do as adversaries do in law, <EOS>
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
The motion's good indeed and be it so, <EOS>
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself, <EOS>
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me; <EOS>
That I disdain: but for these other gawds, <EOS>
Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself, <EOS>
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat; <EOS>
Or what you will command me will I do, <EOS>
So well I know my duty to my elders. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell <EOS>
Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive <EOS>
I never yet beheld that special face <EOS>
Which I could fancy more than any other. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio? <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
If you affect him, sister, here I swear <EOS>
I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have <EOS>
him. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
O then, belike, you fancy riches more: <EOS>
You will have Gremio to keep you fair. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Is it for him you do envy me so? <EOS>
Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive <EOS>
You have but jested with me all this while: <EOS>
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
If that be jest, then all the rest was so. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence? <EOS>
Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps. <EOS>
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her. <EOS>
For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit, <EOS>
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee? <EOS>
When did she cross thee with a bitter word? <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see <EOS>
She is your treasure, she must have a husband; <EOS>
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day <EOS>
And for your love to her lead apes in hell. <EOS>
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep <EOS>
Till I can find occasion of revenge. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I? <EOS>
But who comes here? <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Good morrow, neighbour Baptista. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Good morrow, neighbour Gremio. <EOS>
God save you, gentlemen! <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter <EOS>
Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous? <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
You are too blunt: go to it orderly. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave. <EOS>
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir, <EOS>
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit, <EOS>
Her affability and bashful modesty, <EOS>
Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior, <EOS>
Am bold to show myself a forward guest <EOS>
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness <EOS>
Of that report which I so oft have heard. <EOS>
And, for an entrance to my entertainment, <EOS>
I do present you with a man of mine, <EOS>
Cunning in music and the mathematics, <EOS>
To instruct her fully in those sciences, <EOS>
Whereof I know she is not ignorant: <EOS>
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong: <EOS>
His name is Licio, born in Mantua. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake. <EOS>
But for my daughter Katharina, this I know, <EOS>
She is not for your turn, the more my grief. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
I see you do not mean to part with her, <EOS>
Or else you like not of my company. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find. <EOS>
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son, <EOS>
A man well known throughout all Italy. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray, <EOS>
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too: <EOS>
Baccare! you are marvellous forward. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your <EOS>
wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am <EOS>
sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself, <EOS>
that have been more kindly beholding to you than <EOS>
any, freely give unto you this young scholar, <EOS>
that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning <EOS>
in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other <EOS>
in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray, <EOS>
accept his service. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio. <EOS>
Welcome, good Cambio. <EOS>
But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger: <EOS>
may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own, <EOS>
That, being a stranger in this city here, <EOS>
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter, <EOS>
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous. <EOS>
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me, <EOS>
In the preferment of the eldest sister. <EOS>
This liberty is all that I request, <EOS>
That, upon knowledge of my parentage, <EOS>
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo <EOS>
And free access and favour as the rest: <EOS>
And, toward the education of your daughters, <EOS>
I here bestow a simple instrument, <EOS>
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books: <EOS>
If you accept them, then their worth is great. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
A mighty man of Pisa; by report <EOS>
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir, <EOS>
Take you the lute, and you the set of books; <EOS>
You shall go see your pupils presently. <EOS>
Holla, within! <EOS>
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen <EOS>
To my daughters; and tell them both, <EOS>
These are their tutors: bid them use them well. <EOS>
We will go walk a little in the orchard, <EOS>
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome, <EOS>
And so I pray you all to think yourselves. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste, <EOS>
And every day I cannot come to woo. <EOS>
You knew my father well, and in him me, <EOS>
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods, <EOS>
Which I have better'd rather than decreased: <EOS>
Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love, <EOS>
What dowry shall I have with her to wife? <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
After my death the one half of my lands, <EOS>
And in possession twenty thousand crowns. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of <EOS>
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me, <EOS>
In all my lands and leases whatsoever: <EOS>
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us, <EOS>
That covenants may be kept on either hand. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd, <EOS>
That is, her love; for that is all in all. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father, <EOS>
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded; <EOS>
And where two raging fires meet together <EOS>
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury: <EOS>
Though little fire grows great with little wind, <EOS>
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all: <EOS>
So I to her and so she yields to me; <EOS>
For I am rough and woo not like a babe. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed! <EOS>
But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds, <EOS>
That shake not, though they blow perpetually. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale? <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
What, will my daughter prove a good musician? <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier <EOS>
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute? <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me. <EOS>
I did but tell her she mistook her frets, <EOS>
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering; <EOS>
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit, <EOS>
'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume <EOS>
with them:' <EOS>
And, with that word, she struck me on the head, <EOS>
And through the instrument my pate made way; <EOS>
And there I stood amazed for a while, <EOS>
As on a pillory, looking through the lute; <EOS>
While she did call me rascal fiddler <EOS>
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms, <EOS>
As had she studied to misuse me so. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench; <EOS>
I love her ten times more than e'er I did: <EOS>
O, how I long to have some chat with her! <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Well, go with me and be not so discomfited: <EOS>
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter; <EOS>
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns. <EOS>
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us, <EOS>
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
I pray you do. <EOS>
I will attend her here, <EOS>
And woo her with some spirit when she comes. <EOS>
Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain <EOS>
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale: <EOS>
Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear <EOS>
As morning roses newly wash'd with dew: <EOS>
Say she be mute and will not speak a word; <EOS>
Then I'll commend her volubility, <EOS>
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence: <EOS>
If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks, <EOS>
As though she bid me stay by her a week: <EOS>
If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day <EOS>
When I shall ask the banns and when be married. <EOS>
But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak. <EOS>
Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing: <EOS>
They call me Katharina that do talk of me. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate, <EOS>
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst; <EOS>
But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom <EOS>
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate, <EOS>
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate, <EOS>
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation; <EOS>
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town, <EOS>
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded, <EOS>
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs, <EOS>
Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither <EOS>
Remove you hence: I knew you at the first <EOS>
You were a moveable. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Why, what's a moveable? <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
A join'd-stool. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Asses are made to bear, and so are you. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Women are made to bear, and so are you. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
No such jade as you, if me you mean. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee; <EOS>
For, knowing thee to be but young and light-- <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Too light for such a swain as you to catch; <EOS>
And yet as heavy as my weight should be. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Should be! should--buzz! <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee? <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
If I be waspish, best beware my sting. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
My remedy is then, to pluck it out. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies, <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Who knows not where a wasp does <EOS>
wear his sting? In his tail. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
In his tongue. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Whose tongue? <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again, <EOS>
Good Kate; I am a gentleman. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
That I'll try. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
So may you lose your arms: <EOS>
If you strike me, you are no gentleman; <EOS>
And if no gentleman, why then no arms. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books! <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
What is your crest? a coxcomb? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
It is my fashion, when I see a crab. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
There is, there is. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Then show it me. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Had I a glass, I would. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
What, you mean my face? <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Well aim'd of such a young one. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Yet you are wither'd. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
'Tis with cares. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I care not. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle. <EOS>
'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen, <EOS>
And now I find report a very liar; <EOS>
For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous, <EOS>
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers: <EOS>
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance, <EOS>
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will, <EOS>
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk, <EOS>
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers, <EOS>
With gentle conference, soft and affable. <EOS>
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp? <EOS>
O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig <EOS>
Is straight and slender and as brown in hue <EOS>
As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels. <EOS>
O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Did ever Dian so become a grove <EOS>
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait? <EOS>
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate; <EOS>
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful! <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Where did you study all this goodly speech? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
It is extempore, from my mother-wit. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
A witty mother! witless else her son. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Am I not wise? <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Yes; keep you warm. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed: <EOS>
And therefore, setting all this chat aside, <EOS>
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented <EOS>
That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on; <EOS>
And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you. <EOS>
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn; <EOS>
For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty, <EOS>
Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well, <EOS>
Thou must be married to no man but me; <EOS>
For I am he am born to tame you Kate, <EOS>
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate <EOS>
Conformable as other household Kates. <EOS>
Here comes your father: never make denial; <EOS>
I must and will have Katharina to my wife. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
How but well, sir? how but well? <EOS>
It were impossible I should speed amiss. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps? <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Call you me daughter? now, I promise you <EOS>
You have show'd a tender fatherly regard, <EOS>
To wish me wed to one half lunatic; <EOS>
A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack, <EOS>
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world, <EOS>
That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her: <EOS>
If she be curst, it is for policy, <EOS>
For she's not froward, but modest as the dove; <EOS>
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn; <EOS>
For patience she will prove a second Grissel, <EOS>
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity: <EOS>
And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together, <EOS>
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee <EOS>
hang'd first. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part! <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself: <EOS>
If she and I be pleased, what's that to you? <EOS>
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone, <EOS>
That she shall still be curst in company. <EOS>
I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe <EOS>
How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate! <EOS>
She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss <EOS>
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath, <EOS>
That in a twink she won me to her love. <EOS>
O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see, <EOS>
How tame, when men and women are alone, <EOS>
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew. <EOS>
Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice, <EOS>
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day. <EOS>
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests; <EOS>
I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
I know not what to say: but give me your hands; <EOS>
God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Amen, say we: we will be witnesses. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu; <EOS>
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace: <EOS>
We will have rings and things and fine array; <EOS>
And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly? <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part, <EOS>
And venture madly on a desperate mart. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you: <EOS>
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch. <EOS>
But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter: <EOS>
Now is the day we long have looked for: <EOS>
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
And I am one that love Bianca more <EOS>
Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Graybeard, thy love doth freeze. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
But thine doth fry. <EOS>
Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife: <EOS>
'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both <EOS>
That can assure my daughter greatest dower <EOS>
Shall have my Bianca's love. <EOS>
Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her? <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
First, as you know, my house within the city <EOS>
Is richly furnished with plate and gold; <EOS>
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands; <EOS>
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry; <EOS>
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns; <EOS>
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints, <EOS>
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies, <EOS>
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl, <EOS>
Valance of Venice gold in needlework, <EOS>
Pewter and brass and all things that belong <EOS>
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm <EOS>
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail, <EOS>
Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls, <EOS>
And all things answerable to this portion. <EOS>
Myself am struck in years, I must confess; <EOS>
And if I die to-morrow, this is hers, <EOS>
If whilst I live she will be only mine. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me: <EOS>
I am my father's heir and only son: <EOS>
If I may have your daughter to my wife, <EOS>
I'll leave her houses three or four as good, <EOS>
Within rich Pisa walls, as any one <EOS>
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua; <EOS>
Besides two thousand ducats by the year <EOS>
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure. <EOS>
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio? <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Two thousand ducats by the year of land! <EOS>
My land amounts not to so much in all: <EOS>
That she shall have; besides an argosy <EOS>
That now is lying in Marseilles' road. <EOS>
What, have I choked you with an argosy? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less <EOS>
Than three great argosies; besides two galliases, <EOS>
And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her, <EOS>
And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more; <EOS>
And she can have no more than all I have: <EOS>
If you like me, she shall have me and mine. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world, <EOS>
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
I must confess your offer is the best; <EOS>
And, let your father make her the assurance, <EOS>
She is your own; else, you must pardon me, <EOS>
if you should die before him, where's her dower? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
That's but a cavil: he is old, I young. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
And may not young men die, as well as old? <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Well, gentlemen, <EOS>
I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know <EOS>
My daughter Katharina is to be married: <EOS>
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca <EOS>
Be bride to you, if you this assurance; <EOS>
If not, Signior Gremio: <EOS>
And so, I take my leave, and thank you both. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Adieu, good neighbour. <EOS>
Now I fear thee not: <EOS>
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool <EOS>
To give thee all, and in his waning age <EOS>
Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy! <EOS>
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide! <EOS>
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten. <EOS>
'Tis in my head to do my master good: <EOS>
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio <EOS>
Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;' <EOS>
And that's a wonder: fathers commonly <EOS>
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing, <EOS>
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir: <EOS>
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment <EOS>
Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal? <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
But, wrangling pedant, this is <EOS>
The patroness of heavenly harmony: <EOS>
Then give me leave to have prerogative; <EOS>
And when in music we have spent an hour, <EOS>
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Preposterous ass, that never read so far <EOS>
To know the cause why music was ordain'd! <EOS>
Was it not to refresh the mind of man <EOS>
After his studies or his usual pain? <EOS>
Then give me leave to read philosophy, <EOS>
And while I pause, serve in your harmony. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong, <EOS>
To strive for that which resteth in my choice: <EOS>
I am no breeching scholar in the schools; <EOS>
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times, <EOS>
But learn my lessons as I please myself. <EOS>
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down: <EOS>
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles; <EOS>
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune? <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
That will be never: tune your instrument. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Where left we last? <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Here, madam: <EOS>
'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus; <EOS>
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.' <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Construe them. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am <EOS>
Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa, <EOS>
'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love; <EOS>
'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes <EOS>
a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,' <EOS>
bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might <EOS>
beguile the old pantaloon. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Madam, my instrument's in tune. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat <EOS>
Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I <EOS>
trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed <EOS>
he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,' <EOS>
despair not. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Madam, 'tis now in tune. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
All but the base. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars. <EOS>
How fiery and forward our pedant is! <EOS>
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love: <EOS>
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides <EOS>
Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
I must believe my master; else, I promise you, <EOS>
I should be arguing still upon that doubt: <EOS>
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you: <EOS>
Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray, <EOS>
That I have been thus pleasant with you both. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
You may go walk, and give me leave a while: <EOS>
My lessons make no music in three parts. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait, <EOS>
And watch withal; for, but I be deceived, <EOS>
Our fine musician groweth amorous. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Madam, before you touch the instrument, <EOS>
To learn the order of my fingering, <EOS>
I must begin with rudiments of art; <EOS>
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort, <EOS>
More pleasant, pithy and effectual, <EOS>
Than hath been taught by any of my trade: <EOS>
And there it is in writing, fairly drawn. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Why, I am past my gamut long ago. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Servant: <EOS>
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books <EOS>
And help to dress your sister's chamber up: <EOS>
You know to-morrow is the wedding-day. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
But I have cause to pry into this pedant: <EOS>
Methinks he looks as though he were in love: <EOS>
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble <EOS>
To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale, <EOS>
Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging, <EOS>
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced <EOS>
To give my hand opposed against my heart <EOS>
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen; <EOS>
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure. <EOS>
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool, <EOS>
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior: <EOS>
And, to be noted for a merry man, <EOS>
He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage, <EOS>
Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns; <EOS>
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd. <EOS>
Now must the world point at poor Katharina, <EOS>
And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife, <EOS>
If it would please him come and marry her!' <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too. <EOS>
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well, <EOS>
Whatever fortune stays him from his word: <EOS>
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise; <EOS>
Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Would Katharina had never seen him though! <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep; <EOS>
For such an injury would vex a very saint, <EOS>
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Master, master! news, old news, and such news as <EOS>
you never heard of! <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Is it new and old too? how may that be? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming? <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Is he come? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Why, no, sir. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
What then? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
He is coming. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
When will he be here? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
When he stands where I am and sees you there. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
But say, what to thine old news? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old <EOS>
jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair <EOS>
of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled, <EOS>
another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the <EOS>
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless; <EOS>
with two broken points: his horse hipped with an <EOS>
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred; <EOS>
besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose <EOS>
in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected <EOS>
with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with <EOS>
spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives, <EOS>
stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the <EOS>
bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten; <EOS>
near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit <EOS>
and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being <EOS>
restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been <EOS>
often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth <EOS>
six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure, <EOS>
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down <EOS>
in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Who comes with him? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned <EOS>
like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a <EOS>
kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red <EOS>
and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty <EOS>
fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a <EOS>
very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian <EOS>
footboy or a gentleman's lackey. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion; <EOS>
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Why, sir, he comes not. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Didst thou not say he comes? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Who? that Petruchio came? <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Ay, that Petruchio came. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Why, that's all one. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Nay, by Saint Jamy, <EOS>
I hold you a penny, <EOS>
A horse and a man <EOS>
Is more than one, <EOS>
And yet not many. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Come, where be these gallants? who's at home? <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
You are welcome, sir. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
And yet I come not well. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
And yet you halt not. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Not so well apparell'd <EOS>
As I wish you were. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Were it better, I should rush in thus. <EOS>
But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride? <EOS>
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown: <EOS>
And wherefore gaze this goodly company, <EOS>
As if they saw some wondrous monument, <EOS>
Some comet or unusual prodigy? <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day: <EOS>
First were we sad, fearing you would not come; <EOS>
Now sadder, that you come so unprovided. <EOS>
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate, <EOS>
An eye-sore to our solemn festival! <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
And tells us, what occasion of import <EOS>
Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife, <EOS>
And sent you hither so unlike yourself? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear: <EOS>
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word, <EOS>
Though in some part enforced to digress; <EOS>
Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse <EOS>
As you shall well be satisfied withal. <EOS>
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her: <EOS>
The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
See not your bride in these unreverent robes: <EOS>
Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words: <EOS>
To me she's married, not unto my clothes: <EOS>
Could I repair what she will wear in me, <EOS>
As I can change these poor accoutrements, <EOS>
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself. <EOS>
But what a fool am I to chat with you, <EOS>
When I should bid good morrow to my bride, <EOS>
And seal the title with a lovely kiss! <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
He hath some meaning in his mad attire: <EOS>
We will persuade him, be it possible, <EOS>
To put on better ere he go to church. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
I'll after him, and see the event of this. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
But to her love concerneth us to add <EOS>
Her father's liking: which to bring to pass, <EOS>
As I before unparted to your worship, <EOS>
I am to get a man,--whate'er he be, <EOS>
It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,-- <EOS>
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa; <EOS>
And make assurance here in Padua <EOS>
Of greater sums than I have promised. <EOS>
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope, <EOS>
And marry sweet Bianca with consent. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Were it not that my fellow-school-master <EOS>
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly, <EOS>
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage; <EOS>
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no, <EOS>
I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
That by degrees we mean to look into, <EOS>
And watch our vantage in this business: <EOS>
We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio, <EOS>
The narrow-prying father, Minola, <EOS>
The quaint musician, amorous Licio; <EOS>
All for my master's sake, Lucentio. <EOS>
Signior Gremio, came you from the church? <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
As willingly as e'er I came from school. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home? <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed, <EOS>
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him! <EOS>
I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest <EOS>
Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife, <EOS>
'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud, <EOS>
That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book; <EOS>
And, as he stoop'd again to take it up, <EOS>
The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff <EOS>
That down fell priest and book and book and priest: <EOS>
'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.' <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
What said the wench when he rose again? <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore, <EOS>
As if the vicar meant to cozen him. <EOS>
But after many ceremonies done, <EOS>
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if <EOS>
He had been aboard, carousing to his mates <EOS>
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel <EOS>
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face; <EOS>
Having no other reason <EOS>
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly <EOS>
And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking. <EOS>
This done, he took the bride about the neck <EOS>
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack <EOS>
That at the parting all the church did echo: <EOS>
And I seeing this came thence for very shame; <EOS>
And after me, I know, the rout is coming. <EOS>
Such a mad marriage never was before: <EOS>
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains: <EOS>
I know you think to dine with me to-day, <EOS>
And have prepared great store of wedding cheer; <EOS>
But so it is, my haste doth call me hence, <EOS>
And therefore here I mean to take my leave. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Is't possible you will away to-night? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
I must away to-day, before night come: <EOS>
Make it no wonder; if you knew my business, <EOS>
You would entreat me rather go than stay. <EOS>
And, honest company, I thank you all, <EOS>
That have beheld me give away myself <EOS>
To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife: <EOS>
Dine with my father, drink a health to me; <EOS>
For I must hence; and farewell to you all. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
It may not be. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Let me entreat you. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
It cannot be. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Let me entreat you. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
I am content. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Are you content to stay? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
I am content you shall entreat me stay; <EOS>
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Now, if you love me, stay. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Grumio, my horse. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Nay, then, <EOS>
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day; <EOS>
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself. <EOS>
The door is open, sir; there lies your way; <EOS>
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green; <EOS>
For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself: <EOS>
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom, <EOS>
That take it on you at the first so roundly. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I will be angry: what hast thou to do? <EOS>
Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work. <EOS>
KATARINA: <EOS>
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner: <EOS>
I see a woman may be made a fool, <EOS>
If she had not a spirit to resist. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command. <EOS>
Obey the bride, you that attend on her; <EOS>
Go to the feast, revel and domineer, <EOS>
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead, <EOS>
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves: <EOS>
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me. <EOS>
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret; <EOS>
I will be master of what is mine own: <EOS>
She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house, <EOS>
My household stuff, my field, my barn, <EOS>
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing; <EOS>
And here she stands, touch her whoever dare; <EOS>
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he <EOS>
That stops my way in Padua. Grumio, <EOS>
Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves; <EOS>
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man. <EOS>
Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch <EOS>
thee, Kate: <EOS>
I'll buckler thee against a million. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Of all mad matches never was the like. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister? <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
That, being mad herself, she's madly mated. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Neighbours and friends, though bride and <EOS>
bridegroom wants <EOS>
For to supply the places at the table, <EOS>
You know there wants no junkets at the feast. <EOS>
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place: <EOS>
And let Bianca take her sister's room. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it? <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and <EOS>
all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever <EOS>
man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent <EOS>
before to make a fire, and they are coming after to <EOS>
warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon <EOS>
hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my <EOS>
tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my <EOS>
belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but <EOS>
I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for, <EOS>
considering the weather, a taller man than I will <EOS>
take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis. <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
Who is that calls so coldly? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide <EOS>
from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run <EOS>
but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis. <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast <EOS>
on no water. <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou <EOS>
knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it <EOS>
hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and <EOS>
myself, fellow Curtis. <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and <EOS>
so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a <EOS>
fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress, <EOS>
whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon <EOS>
feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office? <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and <EOS>
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for <EOS>
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death. <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as <EOS>
will thaw. <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
Come, you are so full of cony-catching! <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold. <EOS>
Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house <EOS>
trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the <EOS>
serving-men in their new fustian, their white <EOS>
stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on? <EOS>
Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without, <EOS>
the carpets laid, and every thing in order? <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
First, know, my horse is tired; my master and <EOS>
mistress fallen out. <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
How? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby <EOS>
hangs a tale. <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
Let's ha't, good Grumio. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Lend thine ear. <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
Here. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
There. <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this <EOS>
cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech <EOS>
listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a <EOS>
foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,-- <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
Both of one horse? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
What's that to thee? <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
Why, a horse. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me, <EOS>
thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she <EOS>
under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how <EOS>
miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her <EOS>
with the horse upon her, how he beat me because <EOS>
her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt <EOS>
to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed, <EOS>
that never prayed before, how I cried, how the <EOS>
horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I <EOS>
lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory, <EOS>
which now shall die in oblivion and thou return <EOS>
unexperienced to thy grave. <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
By this reckoning he is more shrew than she. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall <EOS>
find when he comes home. But what talk I of this? <EOS>
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, <EOS>
Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be <EOS>
sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their <EOS>
garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy <EOS>
with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair <EOS>
of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their <EOS>
hands. Are they all ready? <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
They are. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Call them forth. <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to <EOS>
countenance my mistress. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Why, she hath a face of her own. <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
Who knows not that? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to <EOS>
countenance her. <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
I call them forth to credit her. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them. <EOS>
NATHANIEL: <EOS>
Welcome home, Grumio! <EOS>
PHILIP: <EOS>
How now, Grumio! <EOS>
JOSEPH: <EOS>
What, Grumio! <EOS>
NICHOLAS: <EOS>
Fellow Grumio! <EOS>
NATHANIEL: <EOS>
How now, old lad? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow, <EOS>
you;--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce <EOS>
companions, is all ready, and all things neat? <EOS>
NATHANIEL: <EOS>
All things is ready. How near is our master? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be <EOS>
not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Where be these knaves? What, no man at door <EOS>
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse! <EOS>
Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip? <EOS>
ALL SERVING-MEN: <EOS>
Here, here, sir; here, sir. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! <EOS>
You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms! <EOS>
What, no attendance? no regard? no duty? <EOS>
Where is the foolish knave I sent before? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Here, sir; as foolish as I was before. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge! <EOS>
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park, <EOS>
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made, <EOS>
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel; <EOS>
There was no link to colour Peter's hat, <EOS>
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing: <EOS>
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory; <EOS>
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly; <EOS>
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in. <EOS>
Where is the life that late I led-- <EOS>
Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.-- <EOS>
Sound, sound, sound, sound! <EOS>
Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry. <EOS>
Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when? <EOS>
It was the friar of orders grey, <EOS>
As he forth walked on his way:-- <EOS>
Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry: <EOS>
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other. <EOS>
Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho! <EOS>
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence, <EOS>
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither: <EOS>
One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with. <EOS>
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water? <EOS>
Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily. <EOS>
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall? <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave! <EOS>
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach. <EOS>
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I? <EOS>
What's this? mutton? <EOS>
First Servant: <EOS>
Ay. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Who brought it? <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
I. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat. <EOS>
What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook? <EOS>
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser, <EOS>
And serve it thus to me that love it not? <EOS>
Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all; <EOS>
You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves! <EOS>
What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet: <EOS>
The meat was well, if you were so contented. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away; <EOS>
And I expressly am forbid to touch it, <EOS>
For it engenders choler, planteth anger; <EOS>
And better 'twere that both of us did fast, <EOS>
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric, <EOS>
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh. <EOS>
Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended, <EOS>
And, for this night, we'll fast for company: <EOS>
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber. <EOS>
NATHANIEL: <EOS>
Peter, didst ever see the like? <EOS>
PETER: <EOS>
He kills her in her own humour. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Where is he? <EOS>
CURTIS: <EOS>
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her; <EOS>
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul, <EOS>
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak, <EOS>
And sits as one new-risen from a dream. <EOS>
Away, away! for he is coming hither. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Thus have I politicly begun my reign, <EOS>
And 'tis my hope to end successfully. <EOS>
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty; <EOS>
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged, <EOS>
For then she never looks upon her lure. <EOS>
Another way I have to man my haggard, <EOS>
To make her come and know her keeper's call, <EOS>
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites <EOS>
That bate and beat and will not be obedient. <EOS>
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat; <EOS>
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not; <EOS>
As with the meat, some undeserved fault <EOS>
I'll find about the making of the bed; <EOS>
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster, <EOS>
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets: <EOS>
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend <EOS>
That all is done in reverend care of her; <EOS>
And in conclusion she shall watch all night: <EOS>
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl <EOS>
And with the clamour keep her still awake. <EOS>
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness; <EOS>
And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour. <EOS>
He that knows better how to tame a shrew, <EOS>
Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca <EOS>
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio? <EOS>
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said, <EOS>
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Now, mistress, profit you in what you read? <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
What, master, read you? first resolve me that. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
I read that I profess, the Art to Love. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
And may you prove, sir, master of your art! <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart! <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray, <EOS>
You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca <EOS>
Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
O despiteful love! unconstant womankind! <EOS>
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Mistake no more: I am not Licio, <EOS>
Nor a musician, as I seem to be; <EOS>
But one that scorn to live in this disguise, <EOS>
For such a one as leaves a gentleman, <EOS>
And makes a god of such a cullion: <EOS>
Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Signior Hortensio, I have often heard <EOS>
Of your entire affection to Bianca; <EOS>
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness, <EOS>
I will with you, if you be so contented, <EOS>
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio, <EOS>
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow <EOS>
Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her, <EOS>
As one unworthy all the former favours <EOS>
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
And here I take the unfeigned oath, <EOS>
Never to marry with her though she would entreat: <EOS>
Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him! <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn! <EOS>
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath, <EOS>
I will be married to a wealthy widow, <EOS>
Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me <EOS>
As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard. <EOS>
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio. <EOS>
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks, <EOS>
Shall win my love: and so I take my leave, <EOS>
In resolution as I swore before. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace <EOS>
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case! <EOS>
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love, <EOS>
And have forsworn you with Hortensio. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Mistress, we have. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Then we are rid of Licio. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now, <EOS>
That shall be wood and wedded in a day. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
God give him joy! <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Ay, and he'll tame her. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
He says so, Tranio. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
The taming-school! what, is there such a place? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master; <EOS>
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long, <EOS>
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
O master, master, I have watch'd so long <EOS>
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied <EOS>
An ancient angel coming down the hill, <EOS>
Will serve the turn. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
What is he, Biondello? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant, <EOS>
I know not what; but format in apparel, <EOS>
In gait and countenance surely like a father. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
And what of him, Tranio? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
If he be credulous and trust my tale, <EOS>
I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio, <EOS>
And give assurance to Baptista Minola, <EOS>
As if he were the right Vincentio <EOS>
Take in your love, and then let me alone. <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
God save you, sir! <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
And you, sir! you are welcome. <EOS>
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest? <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two: <EOS>
But then up farther, and as for as Rome; <EOS>
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
What countryman, I pray? <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
Of Mantua. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid! <EOS>
And come to Padua, careless of your life? <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
'Tis death for any one in Mantua <EOS>
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause? <EOS>
Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke, <EOS>
For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him, <EOS>
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly: <EOS>
'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come, <EOS>
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about. <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so; <EOS>
For I have bills for money by exchange <EOS>
From Florence and must here deliver them. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Well, sir, to do you courtesy, <EOS>
This will I do, and this I will advise you: <EOS>
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa? <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been, <EOS>
Pisa renowned for grave citizens. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Among them know you one Vincentio? <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
I know him not, but I have heard of him; <EOS>
A merchant of incomparable wealth. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say, <EOS>
In countenance somewhat doth resemble you. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
To save your life in this extremity, <EOS>
This favour will I do you for his sake; <EOS>
And think it not the worst of an your fortunes <EOS>
That you are like to Sir Vincentio. <EOS>
His name and credit shall you undertake, <EOS>
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged: <EOS>
Look that you take upon you as you should; <EOS>
You understand me, sir: so shall you stay <EOS>
Till you have done your business in the city: <EOS>
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it. <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
O sir, I do; and will repute you ever <EOS>
The patron of my life and liberty. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Then go with me to make the matter good. <EOS>
This, by the way, I let you understand; <EOS>
my father is here look'd for every day, <EOS>
To pass assurance of a dower in marriage <EOS>
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here: <EOS>
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you: <EOS>
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears: <EOS>
What, did he marry me to famish me? <EOS>
Beggars, that come unto my father's door, <EOS>
Upon entreaty have a present aims; <EOS>
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity: <EOS>
But I, who never knew how to entreat, <EOS>
Nor never needed that I should entreat, <EOS>
Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep, <EOS>
With oath kept waking and with brawling fed: <EOS>
And that which spites me more than all these wants, <EOS>
He does it under name of perfect love; <EOS>
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat, <EOS>
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death. <EOS>
I prithee go and get me some repast; <EOS>
I care not what, so it be wholesome food. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
What say you to a neat's foot? <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
I fear it is too choleric a meat. <EOS>
How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd? <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric. <EOS>
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard? <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
A dish that I do love to feed upon. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard, <EOS>
Or else you get no beef of Grumio. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Why then, the mustard without the beef. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave, <EOS>
That feed'st me with the very name of meat: <EOS>
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you, <EOS>
That triumph thus upon my misery! <EOS>
Go, get thee gone, I say. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort? <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Mistress, what cheer? <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Faith, as cold as can be. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me. <EOS>
Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am <EOS>
To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee: <EOS>
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks. <EOS>
What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not; <EOS>
And all my pains is sorted to no proof. <EOS>
Here, take away this dish. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I pray you, let it stand. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
The poorest service is repaid with thanks; <EOS>
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I thank you, sir. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame. <EOS>
Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Haberdasher: <EOS>
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Why, this was moulded on a porringer; <EOS>
A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy: <EOS>
Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell, <EOS>
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap: <EOS>
Away with it! come, let me have a bigger. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time, <EOS>
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
When you are gentle, you shall have one too, <EOS>
And not till then. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak; <EOS>
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe: <EOS>
Your betters have endured me say my mind, <EOS>
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears. <EOS>
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart, <EOS>
Or else my heart concealing it will break, <EOS>
And rather than it shall, I will be free <EOS>
Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap, <EOS>
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie: <EOS>
I love thee well, in that thou likest it not. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Love me or love me not, I like the cap; <EOS>
And it I will have, or I will have none. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't. <EOS>
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here? <EOS>
What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon: <EOS>
What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart? <EOS>
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash, <EOS>
Like to a censer in a barber's shop: <EOS>
Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this? <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Tailor: <EOS>
You bid me make it orderly and well, <EOS>
According to the fashion and the time. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd, <EOS>
I did not bid you mar it to the time. <EOS>
Go, hop me over every kennel home, <EOS>
For you shall hop without my custom, sir: <EOS>
I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I never saw a better-fashion'd gown, <EOS>
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable: <EOS>
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee. <EOS>
Tailor: <EOS>
She says your worship means to make <EOS>
a puppet of her. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, <EOS>
thou thimble, <EOS>
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail! <EOS>
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou! <EOS>
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread? <EOS>
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant; <EOS>
Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard <EOS>
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest! <EOS>
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown. <EOS>
Tailor: <EOS>
Your worship is deceived; the gown is made <EOS>
Just as my master had direction: <EOS>
Grumio gave order how it should be done. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff. <EOS>
Tailor: <EOS>
But how did you desire it should be made? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Marry, sir, with needle and thread. <EOS>
Tailor: <EOS>
But did you not request to have it cut? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Thou hast faced many things. <EOS>
Tailor: <EOS>
I have. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not <EOS>
me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto <EOS>
thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did <EOS>
not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest. <EOS>
Tailor: <EOS>
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Read it. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so. <EOS>
Tailor: <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in <EOS>
the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom <EOS>
of brown thread: I said a gown. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Proceed. <EOS>
Tailor: <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
I confess the cape. <EOS>
Tailor: <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
I confess two sleeves. <EOS>
Tailor: <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Ay, there's the villany. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill. <EOS>
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and <EOS>
sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee, <EOS>
though thy little finger be armed in a thimble. <EOS>
Tailor: <EOS>
This is true that I say: an I had thee <EOS>
in place where, thou shouldst know it. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
I am for thee straight: take thou the <EOS>
bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Go, take it up unto thy master's use. <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress' <EOS>
gown for thy master's use! <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Why, sir, what's your conceit in that? <EOS>
GRUMIO: <EOS>
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for: <EOS>
Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use! <EOS>
O, fie, fie, fie! <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow: <EOS>
Take no unkindness of his hasty words: <EOS>
Away! I say; commend me to thy master. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's <EOS>
Even in these honest mean habiliments: <EOS>
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor; <EOS>
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich; <EOS>
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds, <EOS>
So honour peereth in the meanest habit. <EOS>
What is the jay more precious than the lark, <EOS>
Because his fathers are more beautiful? <EOS>
Or is the adder better than the eel, <EOS>
Because his painted skin contents the eye? <EOS>
O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse <EOS>
For this poor furniture and mean array. <EOS>
if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me; <EOS>
And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith, <EOS>
To feast and sport us at thy father's house. <EOS>
Go, call my men, and let us straight to him; <EOS>
And bring our horses unto Long-lane end; <EOS>
There will we mount, and thither walk on foot <EOS>
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock, <EOS>
And well we may come there by dinner-time. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two; <EOS>
And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
It shall be seven ere I go to horse: <EOS>
Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do, <EOS>
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone: <EOS>
I will not go to-day; and ere I do, <EOS>
It shall be what o'clock I say it is. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call? <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
Ay, what else? and but I be deceived <EOS>
Signior Baptista may remember me, <EOS>
Near twenty years ago, in Genoa, <EOS>
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case, <EOS>
With such austerity as 'longeth to a father. <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
I warrant you. <EOS>
But, sir, here comes your boy; <EOS>
'Twere good he were school'd. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello, <EOS>
Now do your duty throughly, I advise you: <EOS>
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Tut, fear not me. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
I told him that your father was at Venice, <EOS>
And that you look'd for him this day in Padua. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink. <EOS>
Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir. <EOS>
Signior Baptista, you are happily met. <EOS>
Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of: <EOS>
I pray you stand good father to me now, <EOS>
Give me Bianca for my patrimony. <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
Soft son! <EOS>
Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua <EOS>
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio <EOS>
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause <EOS>
Of love between your daughter and himself: <EOS>
And, for the good report I hear of you <EOS>
And for the love he beareth to your daughter <EOS>
And she to him, to stay him not too long, <EOS>
I am content, in a good father's care, <EOS>
To have him match'd; and if you please to like <EOS>
No worse than I, upon some agreement <EOS>
Me shall you find ready and willing <EOS>
With one consent to have her so bestow'd; <EOS>
For curious I cannot be with you, <EOS>
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say: <EOS>
Your plainness and your shortness please me well. <EOS>
Right true it is, your son Lucentio here <EOS>
Doth love my daughter and she loveth him, <EOS>
Or both dissemble deeply their affections: <EOS>
And therefore, if you say no more than this, <EOS>
That like a father you will deal with him <EOS>
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower, <EOS>
The match is made, and all is done: <EOS>
Your son shall have my daughter with consent. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best <EOS>
We be affied and such assurance ta'en <EOS>
As shall with either part's agreement stand? <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know, <EOS>
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants: <EOS>
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still; <EOS>
And happily we might be interrupted. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Then at my lodging, an it like you: <EOS>
There doth my father lie; and there, this night, <EOS>
We'll pass the business privately and well. <EOS>
Send for your daughter by your servant here: <EOS>
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently. <EOS>
The worst is this, that, at so slender warning, <EOS>
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home, <EOS>
And bid Bianca make her ready straight; <EOS>
And, if you will, tell what hath happened, <EOS>
Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua, <EOS>
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
I pray the gods she may with all my heart! <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone. <EOS>
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way? <EOS>
Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer: <EOS>
Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
I follow you. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Cambio! <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
What sayest thou, Biondello? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you? <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Biondello, what of that? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to <EOS>
expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
I pray thee, moralize them. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the <EOS>
deceiving father of a deceitful son. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
And what of him? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
And then? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your <EOS>
command at all hours. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
And what of all this? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a <EOS>
counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her, <EOS>
'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the <EOS>
church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient <EOS>
honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for, <EOS>
I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for <EOS>
ever and a day. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Hearest thou, Biondello? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an <EOS>
afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to <EOS>
stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu, <EOS>
sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint <EOS>
Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against <EOS>
you come with your appendix. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
I may, and will, if she be so contented: <EOS>
She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt? <EOS>
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her: <EOS>
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's. <EOS>
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon! <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
I say it is the moon that shines so bright. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I know it is the sun that shines so bright. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself, <EOS>
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list, <EOS>
Or ere I journey to your father's house. <EOS>
Go on, and fetch our horses back again. <EOS>
Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd! <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Say as he says, or we shall never go. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Forward, I pray, since we have come so far, <EOS>
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please: <EOS>
An if you please to call it a rush-candle, <EOS>
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
I say it is the moon. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
I know it is the moon. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun: <EOS>
But sun it is not, when you say it is not; <EOS>
And the moon changes even as your mind. <EOS>
What you will have it named, even that it is; <EOS>
And so it shall be so for Katharina. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run, <EOS>
And not unluckily against the bias. <EOS>
But, soft! company is coming here. <EOS>
Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away? <EOS>
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too, <EOS>
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman? <EOS>
Such war of white and red within her cheeks! <EOS>
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty, <EOS>
As those two eyes become that heavenly face? <EOS>
Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee. <EOS>
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet, <EOS>
Whither away, or where is thy abode? <EOS>
Happy the parents of so fair a child; <EOS>
Happier the man, whom favourable stars <EOS>
Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow! <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad: <EOS>
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd, <EOS>
And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes, <EOS>
That have been so bedazzled with the sun <EOS>
That everything I look on seemeth green: <EOS>
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father; <EOS>
Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known <EOS>
Which way thou travellest: if along with us, <EOS>
We shall be joyful of thy company. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Fair sir, and you my merry mistress, <EOS>
That with your strange encounter much amazed me, <EOS>
My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa; <EOS>
And bound I am to Padua; there to visit <EOS>
A son of mine, which long I have not seen. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
What is his name? <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Lucentio, gentle sir. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Happily we met; the happier for thy son. <EOS>
And now by law, as well as reverend age, <EOS>
I may entitle thee my loving father: <EOS>
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman, <EOS>
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not, <EOS>
Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem, <EOS>
Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth; <EOS>
Beside, so qualified as may beseem <EOS>
The spouse of any noble gentleman. <EOS>
Let me embrace with old Vincentio, <EOS>
And wander we to see thy honest son, <EOS>
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
But is it true? or else is it your pleasure, <EOS>
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest <EOS>
Upon the company you overtake? <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
I do assure thee, father, so it is. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Come, go along, and see the truth hereof; <EOS>
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart. <EOS>
Have to my widow! and if she be froward, <EOS>
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee <EOS>
at home; therefore leave us. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and <EOS>
then come back to my master's as soon as I can. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house: <EOS>
My father's bears more toward the market-place; <EOS>
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
You shall not choose but drink before you go: <EOS>
I think I shall command your welcome here, <EOS>
And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
They're busy within; you were best knock louder. <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate? <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir? <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to <EOS>
make merry withal? <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall <EOS>
need none, so long as I live. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua. <EOS>
Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, <EOS>
I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is <EOS>
come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him. <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here <EOS>
looking out at the window. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Art thou his father? <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to <EOS>
cozen somebody in this city under my countenance. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
I have seen them in the church together: God send <EOS>
'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old <EOS>
master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Hope I may choose, sir. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I <EOS>
never saw you before in all my life. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see <EOS>
thy master's father, Vincentio? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir: <EOS>
see where he looks out of the window. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Is't so, indeed. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me. <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
Help, son! help, Signior Baptista! <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of <EOS>
this controversy. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant? <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal <EOS>
gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet <EOS>
hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I <EOS>
am undone! I am undone! while I play the good <EOS>
husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at <EOS>
the university. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
How now! what's the matter? <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
What, is the man lunatic? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your <EOS>
habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir, <EOS>
what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I <EOS>
thank my good father, I am able to maintain it. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do <EOS>
you think is his name? <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought <EOS>
him up ever since he was three years old, and his <EOS>
name is Tranio. <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is <EOS>
mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold <EOS>
on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my <EOS>
son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio? <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Call forth an officer. <EOS>
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista, <EOS>
I charge you see that he be forthcoming. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Carry me to the gaol! <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be <EOS>
cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this <EOS>
is the right Vincentio. <EOS>
Pedant: <EOS>
Swear, if thou darest. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Nay, I dare not swear it. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him! <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O <EOS>
monstrous villain! <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him, <EOS>
forswear him, or else we are all undone. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Lives my sweet son? <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Pardon, dear father. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
How hast thou offended? <EOS>
Where is Lucentio? <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Here's Lucentio, <EOS>
Right son to the right Vincentio; <EOS>
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine, <EOS>
While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all! <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Where is that damned villain Tranio, <EOS>
That faced and braved me in this matter so? <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio? <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Cambio is changed into Lucentio. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love <EOS>
Made me exchange my state with Tranio, <EOS>
While he did bear my countenance in the town; <EOS>
And happily I have arrived at the last <EOS>
Unto the wished haven of my bliss. <EOS>
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to; <EOS>
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent <EOS>
me to the gaol. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter <EOS>
without asking my good will? <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but <EOS>
I will in, to be revenged for this villany. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown. <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest, <EOS>
Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
First kiss me, Kate, and we will. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
What, in the midst of the street? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
What, art thou ashamed of me? <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate: <EOS>
Better once than never, for never too late. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
At last, though long, our jarring notes agree: <EOS>
And time it is, when raging war is done, <EOS>
To smile at scapes and perils overblown. <EOS>
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome, <EOS>
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine. <EOS>
Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina, <EOS>
And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow, <EOS>
Feast with the best, and welcome to my house: <EOS>
My banquet is to close our stomachs up, <EOS>
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down; <EOS>
For now we sit to chat as well as eat. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat! <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Padua affords nothing but what is kind. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
For both our sakes, I would that word were true. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow. <EOS>
Widow: <EOS>
Then never trust me, if I be afeard. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense: <EOS>
I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you. <EOS>
Widow: <EOS>
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Roundly replied. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Mistress, how mean you that? <EOS>
Widow: <EOS>
Thus I conceive by him. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that? <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
My widow says, thus she conceives her tale. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:' <EOS>
I pray you, tell me what you meant by that. <EOS>
Widow: <EOS>
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew, <EOS>
Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe: <EOS>
And now you know my meaning, <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
A very mean meaning. <EOS>
Widow: <EOS>
Right, I mean you. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
And I am mean indeed, respecting you. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
To her, Kate! <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
To her, widow! <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
That's my office. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad! <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks? <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Believe me, sir, they butt together well. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body <EOS>
Would say your head and butt were head and horn. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you? <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun, <EOS>
Have at you for a bitter jest or two! <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush; <EOS>
And then pursue me as you draw your bow. <EOS>
You are welcome all. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio. <EOS>
This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not; <EOS>
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound, <EOS>
Which runs himself and catches for his master. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
A good swift simile, but something currish. <EOS>
TRANIO: <EOS>
'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself: <EOS>
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
A' has a little gall'd me, I confess; <EOS>
And, as the jest did glance away from me, <EOS>
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio, <EOS>
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance <EOS>
Let's each one send unto his wife; <EOS>
And he whose wife is most obedient <EOS>
To come at first when he doth send for her, <EOS>
Shall win the wager which we will propose. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Content. What is the wager? <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Twenty crowns. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Twenty crowns! <EOS>
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound, <EOS>
But twenty times so much upon my wife. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
A hundred then. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Content. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
A match! 'tis done. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Who shall begin? <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
That will I. <EOS>
Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me. <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
I go. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself. <EOS>
How now! what news? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
Sir, my mistress sends you word <EOS>
That she is busy and she cannot come. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
How! she is busy and she cannot come! <EOS>
Is that an answer? <EOS>
GREMIO: <EOS>
Ay, and a kind one too: <EOS>
Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
I hope better. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife <EOS>
To come to me forthwith. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
O, ho! entreat her! <EOS>
Nay, then she must needs come. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
I am afraid, sir, <EOS>
Do what you can, yours will not be entreated. <EOS>
Now, where's my wife? <EOS>
BIONDELLO: <EOS>
She says you have some goodly jest in hand: <EOS>
She will not come: she bids you come to her. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile, <EOS>
Intolerable, not to be endured! <EOS>
Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress; <EOS>
Say, I command her to come to me. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
I know her answer. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
What? <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
She will not. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
The fouler fortune mine, and there an end. <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina! <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
What is your will, sir, that you send for me? <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife? <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
They sit conferring by the parlor fire. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come. <EOS>
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands: <EOS>
Away, I say, and bring them hither straight. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder. <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
And so it is: I wonder what it bodes. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life, <EOS>
And awful rule and right supremacy; <EOS>
And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy? <EOS>
BAPTISTA: <EOS>
Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio! <EOS>
The wager thou hast won; and I will add <EOS>
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns; <EOS>
Another dowry to another daughter, <EOS>
For she is changed, as she had never been. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Nay, I will win my wager better yet <EOS>
And show more sign of her obedience, <EOS>
Her new-built virtue and obedience. <EOS>
See where she comes and brings your froward wives <EOS>
As prisoners to her womanly persuasion. <EOS>
Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not: <EOS>
Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot. <EOS>
Widow: <EOS>
Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh, <EOS>
Till I be brought to such a silly pass! <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this? <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
I would your duty were as foolish too: <EOS>
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca, <EOS>
Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time. <EOS>
BIANCA: <EOS>
The more fool you, for laying on my duty. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women <EOS>
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands. <EOS>
Widow: <EOS>
Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Come on, I say; and first begin with her. <EOS>
Widow: <EOS>
She shall not. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
I say she shall: and first begin with her. <EOS>
KATHARINA: <EOS>
Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow, <EOS>
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes, <EOS>
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor: <EOS>
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads, <EOS>
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds, <EOS>
And in no sense is meet or amiable. <EOS>
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled, <EOS>
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty; <EOS>
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty <EOS>
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it. <EOS>
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper, <EOS>
Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee, <EOS>
And for thy maintenance commits his body <EOS>
To painful labour both by sea and land, <EOS>
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold, <EOS>
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe; <EOS>
And craves no other tribute at thy hands <EOS>
But love, fair looks and true obedience; <EOS>
Too little payment for so great a debt. <EOS>
Such duty as the subject owes the prince <EOS>
Even such a woman oweth to her husband; <EOS>
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour, <EOS>
And not obedient to his honest will, <EOS>
What is she but a foul contending rebel <EOS>
And graceless traitor to her loving lord? <EOS>
I am ashamed that women are so simple <EOS>
To offer war where they should kneel for peace; <EOS>
Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway, <EOS>
When they are bound to serve, love and obey. <EOS>
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, <EOS>
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world, <EOS>
But that our soft conditions and our hearts <EOS>
Should well agree with our external parts? <EOS>
Come, come, you froward and unable worms! <EOS>
My mind hath been as big as one of yours, <EOS>
My heart as great, my reason haply more, <EOS>
To bandy word for word and frown for frown; <EOS>
But now I see our lances are but straws, <EOS>
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare, <EOS>
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are. <EOS>
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot, <EOS>
And place your hands below your husband's foot: <EOS>
In token of which duty, if he please, <EOS>
My hand is ready; may it do him ease. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't. <EOS>
VINCENTIO: <EOS>
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
But a harsh hearing when women are froward. <EOS>
PETRUCHIO: <EOS>
Come, Kate, we'll to bed. <EOS>
We three are married, but you two are sped. <EOS>
'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white; <EOS>
And, being a winner, God give you good night! <EOS>
HORTENSIO: <EOS>
Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew. <EOS>
LUCENTIO: <EOS>
'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so. <EOS>
Master: <EOS>
Boatswain! <EOS>
Boatswain: <EOS>
Here, master: what cheer? <EOS>
Master: <EOS>
Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely, <EOS>
or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir. <EOS>
Boatswain: <EOS>
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! <EOS>
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the <EOS>
master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind, <EOS>
if room enough! <EOS>
ALONSO: <EOS>
Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master? <EOS>
Play the men. <EOS>
Boatswain: <EOS>
I pray now, keep below. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Where is the master, boatswain? <EOS>
Boatswain: <EOS>
Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your <EOS>
cabins: you do assist the storm. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Nay, good, be patient. <EOS>
Boatswain: <EOS>
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers <EOS>
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard. <EOS>
Boatswain: <EOS>
None that I more love than myself. You are a <EOS>
counsellor; if you can command these elements to <EOS>
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will <EOS>
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you <EOS>
cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make <EOS>
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of <EOS>
the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out <EOS>
of our way, I say. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he <EOS>
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is <EOS>
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his <EOS>
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable, <EOS>
for our own doth little advantage. If he be not <EOS>
born to be hanged, our case is miserable. <EOS>
Boatswain: <EOS>
Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring <EOS>
her to try with main-course. <EOS>
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than <EOS>
the weather or our office. <EOS>
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er <EOS>
and drown? Have you a mind to sink? <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, <EOS>
incharitable dog! <EOS>
Boatswain: <EOS>
Work you then. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! <EOS>
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were <EOS>
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an <EOS>
unstanched wench. <EOS>
Boatswain: <EOS>
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to <EOS>
sea again; lay her off. <EOS>
Mariners: <EOS>
All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost! <EOS>
Boatswain: <EOS>
What, must our mouths be cold? <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them, <EOS>
For our case is as theirs. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
I'm out of patience. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards: <EOS>
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning <EOS>
The washing of ten tides! <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
He'll be hang'd yet, <EOS>
Though every drop of water swear against it <EOS>
And gape at widest to glut him. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Let's all sink with the king. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Let's take leave of him. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an <EOS>
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any <EOS>
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain <EOS>
die a dry death. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
If by your art, my dearest father, you have <EOS>
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. <EOS>
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, <EOS>
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek, <EOS>
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered <EOS>
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel, <EOS>
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her, <EOS>
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock <EOS>
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd. <EOS>
Had I been any god of power, I would <EOS>
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere <EOS>
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and <EOS>
The fraughting souls within her. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Be collected: <EOS>
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart <EOS>
There's no harm done. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
O, woe the day! <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
No harm. <EOS>
I have done nothing but in care of thee, <EOS>
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who <EOS>
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing <EOS>
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better <EOS>
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell, <EOS>
And thy no greater father. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
More to know <EOS>
Did never meddle with my thoughts. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
'Tis time <EOS>
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand, <EOS>
And pluck my magic garment from me. So: <EOS>
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort. <EOS>
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd <EOS>
The very virtue of compassion in thee, <EOS>
I have with such provision in mine art <EOS>
So safely ordered that there is no soul-- <EOS>
No, not so much perdition as an hair <EOS>
Betid to any creature in the vessel <EOS>
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down; <EOS>
For thou must now know farther. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
You have often <EOS>
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd <EOS>
And left me to a bootless inquisition, <EOS>
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.' <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
The hour's now come; <EOS>
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear; <EOS>
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember <EOS>
A time before we came unto this cell? <EOS>
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not <EOS>
Out three years old. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
Certainly, sir, I can. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
By what? by any other house or person? <EOS>
Of any thing the image tell me that <EOS>
Hath kept with thy remembrance. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
'Tis far off <EOS>
And rather like a dream than an assurance <EOS>
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not <EOS>
Four or five women once that tended me? <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it <EOS>
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else <EOS>
In the dark backward and abysm of time? <EOS>
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here, <EOS>
How thou camest here thou mayst. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
But that I do not. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, <EOS>
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and <EOS>
A prince of power. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
Sir, are not you my father? <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and <EOS>
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father <EOS>
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir <EOS>
And princess no worse issued. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
O the heavens! <EOS>
What foul play had we, that we came from thence? <EOS>
Or blessed was't we did? <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Both, both, my girl: <EOS>
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence, <EOS>
But blessedly holp hither. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
O, my heart bleeds <EOS>
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to, <EOS>
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio-- <EOS>
I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should <EOS>
Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself <EOS>
Of all the world I loved and to him put <EOS>
The manage of my state; as at that time <EOS>
Through all the signories it was the first <EOS>
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed <EOS>
In dignity, and for the liberal arts <EOS>
Without a parallel; those being all my study, <EOS>
The government I cast upon my brother <EOS>
And to my state grew stranger, being transported <EOS>
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle-- <EOS>
Dost thou attend me? <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
Sir, most heedfully. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Being once perfected how to grant suits, <EOS>
How to deny them, who to advance and who <EOS>
To trash for over-topping, new created <EOS>
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em, <EOS>
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key <EOS>
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state <EOS>
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was <EOS>
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk, <EOS>
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
O, good sir, I do. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
I pray thee, mark me. <EOS>
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated <EOS>
To closeness and the bettering of my mind <EOS>
With that which, but by being so retired, <EOS>
O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother <EOS>
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust, <EOS>
Like a good parent, did beget of him <EOS>
A falsehood in its contrary as great <EOS>
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit, <EOS>
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded, <EOS>
Not only with what my revenue yielded, <EOS>
But what my power might else exact, like one <EOS>
Who having into truth, by telling of it, <EOS>
Made such a sinner of his memory, <EOS>
To credit his own lie, he did believe <EOS>
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution <EOS>
And executing the outward face of royalty, <EOS>
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing-- <EOS>
Dost thou hear? <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
To have no screen between this part he play'd <EOS>
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be <EOS>
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library <EOS>
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties <EOS>
He thinks me now incapable; confederates-- <EOS>
So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples <EOS>
To give him annual tribute, do him homage, <EOS>
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend <EOS>
The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!-- <EOS>
To most ignoble stooping. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
O the heavens! <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Mark his condition and the event; then tell me <EOS>
If this might be a brother. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
I should sin <EOS>
To think but nobly of my grandmother: <EOS>
Good wombs have borne bad sons. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Now the condition. <EOS>
The King of Naples, being an enemy <EOS>
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit; <EOS>
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises <EOS>
Of homage and I know not how much tribute, <EOS>
Should presently extirpate me and mine <EOS>
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan <EOS>
With all the honours on my brother: whereon, <EOS>
A treacherous army levied, one midnight <EOS>
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open <EOS>
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness, <EOS>
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence <EOS>
Me and thy crying self. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
Alack, for pity! <EOS>
I, not remembering how I cried out then, <EOS>
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint <EOS>
That wrings mine eyes to't. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Hear a little further <EOS>
And then I'll bring thee to the present business <EOS>
Which now's upon's; without the which this story <EOS>
Were most impertinent. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
Wherefore did they not <EOS>
That hour destroy us? <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Well demanded, wench: <EOS>
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not, <EOS>
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set <EOS>
A mark so bloody on the business, but <EOS>
With colours fairer painted their foul ends. <EOS>
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark, <EOS>
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared <EOS>
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd, <EOS>
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats <EOS>
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us, <EOS>
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh <EOS>
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again, <EOS>
Did us but loving wrong. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
Alack, what trouble <EOS>
Was I then to you! <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
O, a cherubim <EOS>
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile. <EOS>
Infused with a fortitude from heaven, <EOS>
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt, <EOS>
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me <EOS>
An undergoing stomach, to bear up <EOS>
Against what should ensue. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
How came we ashore? <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
By Providence divine. <EOS>
Some food we had and some fresh water that <EOS>
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, <EOS>
Out of his charity, being then appointed <EOS>
Master of this design, did give us, with <EOS>
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries, <EOS>
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness, <EOS>
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me <EOS>
From mine own library with volumes that <EOS>
I prize above my dukedom. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
Would I might <EOS>
But ever see that man! <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Now I arise: <EOS>
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. <EOS>
Here in this island we arrived; and here <EOS>
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit <EOS>
Than other princesses can that have more time <EOS>
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir, <EOS>
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason <EOS>
For raising this sea-storm? <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Know thus far forth. <EOS>
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune, <EOS>
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies <EOS>
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience <EOS>
I find my zenith doth depend upon <EOS>
A most auspicious star, whose influence <EOS>
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes <EOS>
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions: <EOS>
Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness, <EOS>
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose. <EOS>
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now. <EOS>
Approach, my Ariel, come. <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come <EOS>
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly, <EOS>
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride <EOS>
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task <EOS>
Ariel and all his quality. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Hast thou, spirit, <EOS>
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee? <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
To every article. <EOS>
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak, <EOS>
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, <EOS>
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide, <EOS>
And burn in many places; on the topmast, <EOS>
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly, <EOS>
Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors <EOS>
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary <EOS>
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks <EOS>
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune <EOS>
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble, <EOS>
Yea, his dread trident shake. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
My brave spirit! <EOS>
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil <EOS>
Would not infect his reason? <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
Not a soul <EOS>
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd <EOS>
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners <EOS>
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, <EOS>
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand, <EOS>
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,-- <EOS>
Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty <EOS>
And all the devils are here.' <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Why that's my spirit! <EOS>
But was not this nigh shore? <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
Close by, my master. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
But are they, Ariel, safe? <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
Not a hair perish'd; <EOS>
On their sustaining garments not a blemish, <EOS>
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me, <EOS>
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle. <EOS>
The king's son have I landed by himself; <EOS>
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs <EOS>
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting, <EOS>
His arms in this sad knot. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Of the king's ship <EOS>
The mariners say how thou hast disposed <EOS>
And all the rest o' the fleet. <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
Safely in harbour <EOS>
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once <EOS>
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew <EOS>
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid: <EOS>
The mariners all under hatches stow'd; <EOS>
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour, <EOS>
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet <EOS>
Which I dispersed, they all have met again <EOS>
And are upon the Mediterranean flote, <EOS>
Bound sadly home for Naples, <EOS>
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd <EOS>
And his great person perish. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Ariel, thy charge <EOS>
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work. <EOS>
What is the time o' the day? <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
Past the mid season. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now <EOS>
Must by us both be spent most preciously. <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, <EOS>
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, <EOS>
Which is not yet perform'd me. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
How now? moody? <EOS>
What is't thou canst demand? <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
My liberty. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Before the time be out? no more! <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
I prithee, <EOS>
Remember I have done thee worthy service; <EOS>
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served <EOS>
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise <EOS>
To bate me a full year. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Dost thou forget <EOS>
From what a torment I did free thee? <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
No. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze <EOS>
Of the salt deep, <EOS>
To run upon the sharp wind of the north, <EOS>
To do me business in the veins o' the earth <EOS>
When it is baked with frost. <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
I do not, sir. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot <EOS>
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy <EOS>
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her? <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
No, sir. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me. <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
Sir, in Argier. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
O, was she so? I must <EOS>
Once in a month recount what thou hast been, <EOS>
Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax, <EOS>
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible <EOS>
To enter human hearing, from Argier, <EOS>
Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did <EOS>
They would not take her life. Is not this true? <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
Ay, sir. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child <EOS>
And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave, <EOS>
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant; <EOS>
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate <EOS>
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands, <EOS>
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, <EOS>
By help of her more potent ministers <EOS>
And in her most unmitigable rage, <EOS>
Into a cloven pine; within which rift <EOS>
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain <EOS>
A dozen years; within which space she died <EOS>
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans <EOS>
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island-- <EOS>
Save for the son that she did litter here, <EOS>
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with <EOS>
A human shape. <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
Yes, Caliban her son. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban <EOS>
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st <EOS>
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans <EOS>
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts <EOS>
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment <EOS>
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax <EOS>
Could not again undo: it was mine art, <EOS>
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape <EOS>
The pine and let thee out. <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
I thank thee, master. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak <EOS>
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till <EOS>
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters. <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
Pardon, master; <EOS>
I will be correspondent to command <EOS>
And do my spiriting gently. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Do so, and after two days <EOS>
I will discharge thee. <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
That's my noble master! <EOS>
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do? <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject <EOS>
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible <EOS>
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape <EOS>
And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence! <EOS>
Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake! <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
The strangeness of your story put <EOS>
Heaviness in me. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Shake it off. Come on; <EOS>
We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never <EOS>
Yields us kind answer. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
'Tis a villain, sir, <EOS>
I do not love to look on. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
But, as 'tis, <EOS>
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire, <EOS>
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices <EOS>
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban! <EOS>
Thou earth, thou! speak. <EOS>
CALIBAN: <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee: <EOS>
Come, thou tortoise! when? <EOS>
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel, <EOS>
Hark in thine ear. <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
My lord it shall be done. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself <EOS>
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth! <EOS>
CALIBAN: <EOS>
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd <EOS>
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen <EOS>
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye <EOS>
And blister you all o'er! <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps, <EOS>
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins <EOS>
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work, <EOS>
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd <EOS>
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging <EOS>
Than bees that made 'em. <EOS>
CALIBAN: <EOS>
I must eat my dinner. <EOS>
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother, <EOS>
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first, <EOS>
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me <EOS>
Water with berries in't, and teach me how <EOS>
To name the bigger light, and how the less, <EOS>
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee <EOS>
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle, <EOS>
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile: <EOS>
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms <EOS>
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you! <EOS>
For I am all the subjects that you have, <EOS>
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me <EOS>
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me <EOS>
The rest o' the island. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Thou most lying slave, <EOS>
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee, <EOS>
Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee <EOS>
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate <EOS>
The honour of my child. <EOS>
CALIBAN: <EOS>
O ho, O ho! would't had been done! <EOS>
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else <EOS>
This isle with Calibans. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Abhorred slave, <EOS>
Which any print of goodness wilt not take, <EOS>
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee, <EOS>
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour <EOS>
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage, <EOS>
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like <EOS>
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes <EOS>
With words that made them known. But thy vile race, <EOS>
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which <EOS>
good natures <EOS>
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou <EOS>
Deservedly confined into this rock, <EOS>
Who hadst deserved more than a prison. <EOS>
CALIBAN: <EOS>
You taught me language; and my profit on't <EOS>
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you <EOS>
For learning me your language! <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Hag-seed, hence! <EOS>
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best, <EOS>
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice? <EOS>
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly <EOS>
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps, <EOS>
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar <EOS>
That beasts shall tremble at thy din. <EOS>
CALIBAN: <EOS>
No, pray thee. <EOS>
I must obey: his art is of such power, <EOS>
It would control my dam's god, Setebos, <EOS>
and make a vassal of him. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
So, slave; hence! <EOS>
Come unto these yellow sands, <EOS>
And then take hands: <EOS>
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd <EOS>
The wild waves whist, <EOS>
Foot it featly here and there; <EOS>
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear. <EOS>
Hark, hark! <EOS>
FERDINAND: <EOS>
Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth? <EOS>
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon <EOS>
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank, <EOS>
Weeping again the king my father's wreck, <EOS>
This music crept by me upon the waters, <EOS>
Allaying both their fury and my passion <EOS>
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it, <EOS>
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone. <EOS>
No, it begins again. <EOS>
Full fathom five thy father lies; <EOS>
Of his bones are coral made; <EOS>
Those are pearls that were his eyes: <EOS>
Nothing of him that doth fade <EOS>
But doth suffer a sea-change <EOS>
Into something rich and strange. <EOS>
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell <EOS>
Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell. <EOS>
FERDINAND: <EOS>
The ditty does remember my drown'd father. <EOS>
This is no mortal business, nor no sound <EOS>
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance <EOS>
And say what thou seest yond. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
What is't? a spirit? <EOS>
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir, <EOS>
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses <EOS>
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest <EOS>
Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd <EOS>
With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him <EOS>
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows <EOS>
And strays about to find 'em. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
I might call him <EOS>
A thing divine, for nothing natural <EOS>
I ever saw so noble. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
FERDINAND: <EOS>
Most sure, the goddess <EOS>
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer <EOS>
May know if you remain upon this island; <EOS>
And that you will some good instruction give <EOS>
How I may bear me here: my prime request, <EOS>
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder! <EOS>
If you be maid or no? <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
No wonder, sir; <EOS>
But certainly a maid. <EOS>
FERDINAND: <EOS>
My language! heavens! <EOS>
I am the best of them that speak this speech, <EOS>
Were I but where 'tis spoken. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
How? the best? <EOS>
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee? <EOS>
FERDINAND: <EOS>
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders <EOS>
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me; <EOS>
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples, <EOS>
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld <EOS>
The king my father wreck'd. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
Alack, for mercy! <EOS>
FERDINAND: <EOS>
Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan <EOS>
And his brave son being twain. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
Why speaks my father so ungently? This <EOS>
Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first <EOS>
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father <EOS>
To be inclined my way! <EOS>
FERDINAND: <EOS>
O, if a virgin, <EOS>
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you <EOS>
The queen of Naples. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Soft, sir! one word more. <EOS>
They are both in either's powers; but this swift business <EOS>
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning <EOS>
Make the prize light. <EOS>
One word more; I charge thee <EOS>
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp <EOS>
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself <EOS>
Upon this island as a spy, to win it <EOS>
From me, the lord on't. <EOS>
FERDINAND: <EOS>
No, as I am a man. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple: <EOS>
If the ill spirit have so fair a house, <EOS>
Good things will strive to dwell with't. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Follow me. <EOS>
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come; <EOS>
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together: <EOS>
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be <EOS>
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks <EOS>
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow. <EOS>
FERDINAND: <EOS>
No; <EOS>
I will resist such entertainment till <EOS>
Mine enemy has more power. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
O dear father, <EOS>
Make not too rash a trial of him, for <EOS>
He's gentle and not fearful. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
What? I say, <EOS>
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor; <EOS>
Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience <EOS>
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward, <EOS>
For I can here disarm thee with this stick <EOS>
And make thy weapon drop. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
Beseech you, father. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Hence! hang not on my garments. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
Sir, have pity; <EOS>
I'll be his surety. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Silence! one word more <EOS>
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What! <EOS>
An advocate for an imposter! hush! <EOS>
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he, <EOS>
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench! <EOS>
To the most of men this is a Caliban <EOS>
And they to him are angels. <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
My affections <EOS>
Are then most humble; I have no ambition <EOS>
To see a goodlier man. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Come on; obey: <EOS>
Thy nerves are in their infancy again <EOS>
And have no vigour in them. <EOS>
FERDINAND: <EOS>
So they are; <EOS>
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. <EOS>
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel, <EOS>
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats, <EOS>
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, <EOS>
Might I but through my prison once a day <EOS>
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth <EOS>
Let liberty make use of; space enough <EOS>
Have I in such a prison. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
MIRANDA: <EOS>
Be of comfort; <EOS>
My father's of a better nature, sir, <EOS>
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted <EOS>
Which now came from him. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Thou shalt be free <EOS>
As mountain winds: but then exactly do <EOS>
All points of my command. <EOS>
ARIEL: <EOS>
To the syllable. <EOS>
PROSPERO: <EOS>
Come, follow. Speak not for him. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause, <EOS>
So have we all, of joy; for our escape <EOS>
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe <EOS>
Is common; every day some sailor's wife, <EOS>
The masters of some merchant and the merchant <EOS>
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle, <EOS>
I mean our preservation, few in millions <EOS>
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh <EOS>
Our sorrow with our comfort. <EOS>
ALONSO: <EOS>
Prithee, peace. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
He receives comfort like cold porridge. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
The visitor will not give him o'er so. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit; <EOS>
by and by it will strike. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Sir,-- <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
One: tell. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd, <EOS>
Comes to the entertainer-- <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
A dollar. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Dolour comes to him, indeed: you <EOS>
have spoken truer than you purposed. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Therefore, my lord,-- <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue! <EOS>
ALONSO: <EOS>
I prithee, spare. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Well, I have done: but yet,-- <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
He will be talking. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good <EOS>
wager, first begins to crow? <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
The old cock. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
The cockerel. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Done. The wager? <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
A laughter. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
A match! <EOS>
ADRIAN: <EOS>
Though this island seem to be desert,-- <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid. <EOS>
ADRIAN: <EOS>
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,-- <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Yet,-- <EOS>
ADRIAN: <EOS>
Yet,-- <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
He could not miss't. <EOS>
ADRIAN: <EOS>
It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate <EOS>
temperance. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Temperance was a delicate wench. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered. <EOS>
ADRIAN: <EOS>
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
As if it had lungs and rotten ones. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Here is everything advantageous to life. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
True; save means to live. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Of that there's none, or little. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green! <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
The ground indeed is tawny. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
With an eye of green in't. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
He misses not much. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
No; he doth but mistake the truth totally. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost <EOS>
beyond credit,-- <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
As many vouched rarities are. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in <EOS>
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and <EOS>
glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with <EOS>
salt water. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not <EOS>
say he lies? <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we <EOS>
put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of <EOS>
the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return. <EOS>
ADRIAN: <EOS>
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to <EOS>
their queen. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Not since widow Dido's time. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in? <EOS>
widow Dido! <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord, <EOS>
how you take it! <EOS>
ADRIAN: <EOS>
'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that: <EOS>
she was of Carthage, not of Tunis. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage. <EOS>
ADRIAN: <EOS>
Carthage? <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
I assure you, Carthage. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath <EOS>
raised the wall and houses too. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
What impossible matter will he make easy next? <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket <EOS>
and give it his son for an apple. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring <EOS>
forth more islands. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Ay. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Why, in good time. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now <EOS>
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage <EOS>
of your daughter, who is now queen. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
And the rarest that e'er came there. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I <EOS>
wore it? I mean, in a sort. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
That sort was well fished for. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage? <EOS>
ALONSO: <EOS>
You cram these words into mine ears against <EOS>
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never <EOS>
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence, <EOS>
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too, <EOS>
Who is so far from Italy removed <EOS>
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir <EOS>
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish <EOS>
Hath made his meal on thee? <EOS>
FRANCISCO: <EOS>
Sir, he may live: <EOS>
I saw him beat the surges under him, <EOS>
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water, <EOS>
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted <EOS>
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head <EOS>
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd <EOS>
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke <EOS>
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd, <EOS>
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt <EOS>
He came alive to land. <EOS>
ALONSO: <EOS>
No, no, he's gone. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, <EOS>
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter, <EOS>
But rather lose her to an African; <EOS>
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye, <EOS>
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't. <EOS>
ALONSO: <EOS>
Prithee, peace. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise <EOS>
By all of us, and the fair soul herself <EOS>
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at <EOS>
Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your <EOS>
son, <EOS>
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have <EOS>
More widows in them of this business' making <EOS>
Than we bring men to comfort them: <EOS>
The fault's your own. <EOS>
ALONSO: <EOS>
So is the dear'st o' the loss. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
My lord Sebastian, <EOS>
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness <EOS>
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore, <EOS>
When you should bring the plaster. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Very well. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
And most chirurgeonly. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
It is foul weather in us all, good sir, <EOS>
When you are cloudy. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Foul weather? <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Very foul. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,-- <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
He'ld sow't with nettle-seed. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Or docks, or mallows. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
And were the king on't, what would I do? <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
'Scape being drunk for want of wine. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
I' the commonwealth I would by contraries <EOS>
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic <EOS>
Would I admit; no name of magistrate; <EOS>
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty, <EOS>
And use of service, none; contract, succession, <EOS>
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none; <EOS>
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil; <EOS>
No occupation; all men idle, all; <EOS>
And women too, but innocent and pure; <EOS>
No sovereignty;-- <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Yet he would be king on't. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the <EOS>
beginning. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
All things in common nature should produce <EOS>
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony, <EOS>
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine, <EOS>
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth, <EOS>
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance, <EOS>
To feed my innocent people. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
No marrying 'mong his subjects? <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
I would with such perfection govern, sir, <EOS>
To excel the golden age. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
God save his majesty! <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Long live Gonzalo! <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
And,--do you mark me, sir? <EOS>
ALONSO: <EOS>
Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
I do well believe your highness; and <EOS>
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, <EOS>
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that <EOS>
they always use to laugh at nothing. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
'Twas you we laughed at. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing <EOS>
to you: so you may continue and laugh at <EOS>
nothing still. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
What a blow was there given! <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
An it had not fallen flat-long. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift <EOS>
the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue <EOS>
in it five weeks without changing. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
We would so, and then go a bat-fowling. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Nay, good my lord, be not angry. <EOS>
GONZALO: <EOS>
No, I warrant you; I will not adventure <EOS>
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh <EOS>
me asleep, for I am very heavy? <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Go sleep, and hear us. <EOS>
ALONSO: <EOS>
What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes <EOS>
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find <EOS>
They are inclined to do so. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Please you, sir, <EOS>
Do not omit the heavy offer of it: <EOS>
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth, <EOS>
It is a comforter. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
We two, my lord, <EOS>
Will guard your person while you take your rest, <EOS>
And watch your safety. <EOS>
ALONSO: <EOS>
Thank you. Wondrous heavy. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
What a strange drowsiness possesses them! <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
It is the quality o' the climate. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
Why <EOS>
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not <EOS>
Myself disposed to sleep. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Nor I; my spirits are nimble. <EOS>
They fell together all, as by consent; <EOS>
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might, <EOS>
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:-- <EOS>
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face, <EOS>
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and <EOS>
My strong imagination sees a crown <EOS>
Dropping upon thy head. <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
What, art thou waking? <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Do you not hear me speak? <EOS>
SEBASTIAN: <EOS>
I do; and surely <EOS>
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st <EOS>
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say? <EOS>
This is a strange repose, to be asleep <EOS>
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving, <EOS>
And yet so fast asleep. <EOS>
ANTONIO: <EOS>
Noble Sebastian, <EOS>
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st <EOS>
Whiles thou art waking. <EOS>
